Speaking of the evil empire...  almost a year ago my
girlfriend applied for a summer internship at IBM (actually,
she applied for two positions).  Since then, she has gotten
at least six rejection letters from various divisions within
the company, most of which she hasn't applied to.  So it's
like, they're passing her resume around and generating a
rejection with each stop!  Wouldn't it be great if TCP/IP
worked this way?

It's not even clear that she has gotten rejections
corresponding to the positions she has applied for.

of Unix.

Let me supply you with an example.  Just today I had the
following dialog with one well known computer manufacturer's
version of Unix:

  > rm temp
  rm: temp directory

  > rmdir temp/
  rmdir: temp/: Is a directory

(Of course if I type the name of the directory -without- the
trailing "/", rmdir works just fine.)  Now just what the
heck braindamage do you suppose results in this idiotic
error message?  "OF COURSE IT'S A DIRECTORY", I shout at my
terminal, "WHY THE HECK DO YOU THINK I'M USING RMDIR?"

Now that's the kind of teeth-grinding experience this

From "man mh-alias"
     To use aliasing in MH, do the following: In your
     .mh_profile, choose a name for your primary alias file,
     say aliases, and add the following three lines:

          ali: -alias aliases
          send: -alias aliases
          whom: -alias aliases

     Create the file aliases in your MH directory.  Start adding...

From my mh_profile
  Path: Mail
  send: -forward
  ali: -alias aliases
  send: -alias aliases
  whom: -alias aliases

From ~/Mail/aliases
  me: ar@somewhere.somewhen.edu

Ok... Try sending a message "To: me"

mh responds.
  me: loses; [USER] 550 me... User unknown
  post: 1 addressee undeliverable
  send: message not delivered to anyone

Half an hour later, while composing this message.
  Eureka! Perhaps mh can't handle the fact that there are
  two lines in my profile that start with "send:". 
  Naaaahhhhhh.

But YES! Unix has wasted another half hour of my
time.  "send -forward -alias aliases" does the trick. (or
maybe it was the other behaviour that was the trick).

Oh, come on now A -- being "single-minded" like this is
too Unix-ified an approach to such a fun thing!

But . . . just to re-establish my credentials on this list,
I found myself in the predicament of having to change a
whole slew of files named foo.a into foo.b.  Should be a
simple job for the Unix equivalent of LOOP, CONCATENATE,
SUBSEQ, right?  Well if SED and AWK weren't scary enough,
the looping facilities for shell scripts are troubling too
-- in particular, it aint anywhere near the same for CSH as
for KSH etc.  After half-an-hour of staring at what passes
for shell-script tutorials, I gave up and wrote it in Emacs
-- using keyboard macros -- and then call Unix 'source'
command.

Note that.  My Operating System ISN'T Unix or SunOS -- it is
in fact EMACS.

Why, until Sun stuck me with a terminal/console whose
screen-manager is a rom-coded FORTH Program that runs at
1200 baud, I didn't even use SunView, OpenLook, or X.  I
only acceeded to the Wonderful World of X/Motif in order to
get my Emacs to run at something more like 9600 baud.  (No
kidding! just ask about the Sparcstations primitive console
mode.)


Incidentally, I do know about the :r "subseq" for CSH (but
not their shells?); however under the Aegis shell of Apollo,
note how easy the task above would be:

mvf {?*}.a @1.b		#r.e. pattern matching -- standard in Apollo world


So you can see why "worse (Unix) is better" is our motto.

Subject: One Hand Clapping.


Today the mischievous Unix kami kicked me in the teeth.
Twice.

I should have seen it coming.  I walked into my office after
some lecture and stepped around some grey-bearded dude that
was talking to my office mate.  "Hi, I'm Brian Kernighan,"
said the grey-bearded dude as I walked by.  

I thought quickly, "Hey, this is the guy that helped invent
C, should I kill him now and take revenge for all humanity?"

"Nice to meet you," I replied and shook his hand.  A little
voice in the back of my head screamed "Coward!"  Now when
the revolution comes and they put Bill Joy and Dennis
Ritchie up against the wall, I'll be shot as a collaborator.
Great...

At this point, I should have known that something terrible
was going to happen.  Something so horrifyingly nasty that,
if I had known beforehand, I would have taken the letter
opener out of my top drawer and gladly cut out my heart and
entrails and fed them to my dog to not have to go through
it.  But that's not what I came here to talk about...

So, I've been dicking around with BSD kernels lately and
have a set of kernel sources on my workstation.  Don't ask
why.  I won't tell you.  I don't even know.  Anyway, I
decided that I didn't need to keep those nasty kernel
sources around anymore since they were four revision letters
old and someone had probably completely rehacked the IPC
code for the sheer hell of it so I cd'ed to the root of the
kernel source tree and typed "rm -rf * &".  "Great," I
thought, "the machine can ditch the 20 megs of shite and I
can do something else."  Ain't multitasking great?

I forgot that rm is aliased to "rm -i" so now the stupid rm
process is bleating in the background, getting turds all
over my screen, about not being sure if it should delete all
these files.  I mean, it's whole purpose in life is to
delete files.  You think it would have a little more panache
about it, especially when I go to the trouble to give it the
gd kill-first-and-ask-questions-later flag.  But no.

So I fg the process and kill it.  Then I unalias rm and
rerun it.  No problem.  Except that after I ran rm the first
time I cd'ed back to the top of my home directory.  Oops.
And this time, rm, starting from the top of my whole
directory tree and freed from its cumbersome wimp complex,
grits its teeth and wipes out those kernel sources and then
some.

"Oh shite," I remarked when I discovered that I had nothing
left but dot-login files.  So now I'm hanging out on the
Plains of Limbo waiting for a demo of the whizzy new
backup-n-restore system that they wrote around here.  It's
not so bad, I guess.  It has a kind of Zen "What is the
listing of an empty directory" quality about it...

Yeah, when I was a boy we used to have to toggle switches on

These days you hear these whining wimps going on about

we had spent $50,000 on the compiler and it was the only
language that ran on our ancient, outmoded hardware
supported and we had no money left after trying to maintain
hundreds of thousands of lines of poorly written, poorly

The sick part was, I WAS NOT EVEN USING UNIX AT THE TIME.

We're working on supporting Lisp on DOS, I guess a good

Or maybe building a bridge out of corn starch.  Anyway, one
of the tools we use provides some Unix style commands, like
our buddy mv.  It seemed a little bit smarter than DOS's
rename.  So I use it.

Now our studio audience can obviously guess what's coming
up.  God forbid you try to mv a file to a name already used
by another file.  With amazing style and grace, I instantly
wipe out a file it took two hours to build.  I don't know
this until later, after it's too late for any DOS Futilities
program to recover it.  DOS may be a flaming abomination,
but at least it will mention that another file already has
that name.

What to do to avoid this in the future?  I can do the weenie
approach of overloading the mv command to first check to see
if the file exists, and then call the idiot savant mv
command.  But instead I choose to purge all the Unix style
commands on my DOS machine and live with an honest simpleton

    few hours of futility, you might discover that "rm"
    creates a subdirectory called DELETED, sets the

	MIT has a nice Cray-II on which we can use as a
computron server (the people "administring" the machine
aren't so nice, but that is a different kind of hatred).
This machine, call it Ed -- MIT decided to, runs UNICOS, a
close cousin to unix.  We use the Cray remotely through a
LISPM front end, so we shouldn't have to see the hideousies
of the underlying unix operating system, right?

	<you guessed it> wrong!

	First I was told that I would have to name my
circuits with properly terse (<14 character) names since
UNICOS can't deal with full-size filenames.  A bit of an
annoyance, but having been warned about this limitation, I
renamed the circuits which I was "sharing" with Ed so he
didn't choke.

	Now, after running moderately-successfully for days
(well, that parts of days in which the machine was up...but
that's another matter), the stream which was reading from
the cray blew out on my LISPM and complained about an out of
bound array index.  Henry, noticing that the file had
ended, thought perhaps the reader code had failed to
properly identify EOF and patched the code accordingly.  This
didn't help.  For several more runs, the return stream would
blow out and the results returned would be truncated.

	Finally (after wasting many hours of both mine and
Ed's), we took a longer look at one of the ~1Mbyte files of
nonsense it actually produced.  Hidden somewhere in the
middle of several streams of numbers was some terse comment
about running out of inodes.  We promptly deleted all the
files we had on Ed and reran the job -- this time with no
complaints.

	Why does it matter how many inodes we use?  In what
sense is quitely truncating a file a reasonable response to
such an occurrence?  Why is the only indication of this
lossage mode burried in a file too large for any sane human
to read?  -- but alas, I guess we all know the answer to

Flame off.

Sorry to be constructive, but I have some friends at Cray
who are in charge of doing things like breaking UNICOS and
sending it back to be fixed.  Who would probably love to
hear your story and see the files if you run into the
problem again.

They're not too happy about UNIX either.  Sufficiently so
that they rewrote most of the kernel from scratch so that
they could get decent performance and reliability.  It also
knows what mag tapes and off-line files are.

As for 14 character file names, I think that COS, a rewrite
of the CDC operating NOS, formerly called KRONOS, and which
was what existed before UNICOS, only allowed seven character
file names.

We now return you to our regularly scheduled flamage.

Flame on.

Oh sure, Unix just loves blank lines.  Why even Unix-Haters
itself isn't immune to blank line disease.  If you ask MC's
SMTP server to show you the expansion of the Unix-Haters
mailing list you get:

  220 MC.LCS.MIT.EDU Server SMTP (Complaints/bugs to:  mmdf@lcs.mit.edu)

Took me a while to catch on that the line that says "

-empty- -string- is an unknown address, and the reason for
that was that it found a blank line in the mailing list

Subject: Syntax Error: Not A Typewriter

There I was, happily hacking away on some T (i.e., Scheme)
code, defining a procedure to translate characters in a
certain special way.  I shovel the definition into the T
process that I have running under Emacs, and I'm told that
the tiny case expression

    (case c
	((#\-) #\_)
	(else (char-downcase c)))

is ill-formed.  (The T expression #\x denotes the character
constant for the character x.)  The error message says:

    ** Syntax error: bad syntax for special form
      (CASE C (-) _)

Huh?  The structure of the case expression in the message
doesn't match that of the expression in the source.  I start
up another T under a shell and load the file in; it works
just fine.  I switch back to the interactive T buffer in
Emacs and type (eq? #\x #\x), which yields

    ** Error: variable EQ?\x\x is unbound

It appears that spaces are spontaneously disappearing when
they occur before '#' characters.  I start poking around at
the T readtable, wondering how it could possibly be
different for a T running under Emacs as compared to a T
running under a shell, when it dawns on me: '#' is the
default erase character, dating back to at least Version 6
Unix.

Now remember that in the dark days of v6 the error message
"Not a typewriter" always made sense, since video terminals,
pseudo-ttys, and network connections hadn't been invented
yet.  So at the time it was at least somewhat logical to
have character deletion echo in a way appropriate to such
devices.  And in the true Unix spirit of cast-in-stone
backwards compatibility with design decisions made in the
context of hardware that was common two decades ago, this
behavior has been maintained to the present day.  

Thus the "line discipline" that has helpfully installed
itself on the pseudo-tty that Emacs is using to talk to the
T process is dutifully interpreting '#' to mean "please
delete the preceding character, if any".  Never mind that
all the line editing is really going on in Emacs.

This is Unix-Haters, so I won't explain why the T running
under the shell was working correctly.  (Er, at least
correctly in this regard; does anything run completely
correctly under Unix?)  Or how I fixed the problem.  But I
will note that '@', which is the default kill (=
line-delete) character under v6, was behaving in a similarly
losing fashion.

Argh.

This reminds me of a favorite one; If you redirect an alias
into a file, the "From" lines aren't "quoted" (or should I
say broken) unless some arcane incantation is whispered over
your sendmail.cf (which is of course neither the default,

screws your file over big time.

Subject: How To Go From Bad To Worse With One Prom Upgrade.


    For some reason, on Sparcs, Sun didn't think that the
scsi device numbers on the drives were good enough, so they
dreamed up their own.  When you're hacking the hardware you
have to remember that 3 is 0 and 0 is 3 and 4 is your tape
drive.  Well, at least they got 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 ok.

    Now I have this external disk cabled up to it and the
drive ID is set at 0, which means it's drive 3, and I want
to boot from tape so I can install sunos on it.  So,
following the instructions in the install manual, I type "b
st()" to boot from scsi tape.  

    Bzzt.  The new roms don't support that syntax for
booting from tape, and in a 5 or 6 line error message,
inform me that the new proper syntax for booting from tape
is "b tape".  Well gee, isn't that nice and user-friendly.
So I type "b tape" and install unix on sd3 (which is
actually disk 0), carefully avoiding scribbling on sd0
(which is actually disk 3) and proceed to reboot.

    Bzzt.  That "b sd(0,3,0)" syntax isn't supported anymore
either.  Nowadays, you're supposed to say "boot disk".
Well, gee, that's nice, but don't want to boot off of disk 3
(sd0), I want to boot off disk 0 (sd3).  So I open the
manual.  Nothing.  I try to call Sun but they won't help me
'cause my boss's name is on the support contract and he
isn't around to tell them it's OK to talk to me.  

    So I played around with it for a while, and finally got
it to boot.  For reasons that leave me somewhat puzzled, Sun
has decided to change their "b sd(0,3,0)" syntax to "b
/sbus/esp@0,800000/sd@0,0".  Isn't that cute, a little Unix
filesystem right there in your prom monitor!  

    It's reassuring to know that my disks are on the sbus
too - I was worried that they had ripped me off there for a
while.  You gotta give these guys credit, though - they
finally fixed the scsi-vs-disk number discrepancy.  At least
in the prom monitor they did.  No sooner had I booted from
sd@0,0 than the Sparcstation started happily fscking away on
its root partition on (you guessed it), sd3.

    We shipped that monstrousity off to Japan the other day,
so with luck I won't have to deal with one again for a
while.

Subject: How To Write A Valid Modern Null Program

Date: 2 Apr 91 00:56:20 GMT
From: DD
Subject: "Invalid null command"

Bourne shell users, accustomed to creating or emptying a
file with a command like:
	>splot
or rewinding a tape with:
	</dev/mt0
are occasionally annoyed to find that csh rejects this
syntax with the confusing message "Invalid null command".

(It is confusing because there is no such thing as a *valid*
null command; attempts to find one will only end in
frustration.)

This can be solved as follows:
	touch /bin/IEFBR14
	chmod 755 IEFBR14

The name is chosen for historical relevance, since most of
us who still use the Bourne shell are Luddites or
recidivists anyway.  Of course,
	IEFBR14 >splot
seems a bit naked without some slashes and an EXEC PGM=, but
that's the way these modern systems are...

Some folks may note a more-than-coincidental resemblance
between this version of IEFBR14 and older versions of
/bin/true.  So it is, but our example lacks the
sophistication of the modern System V "true" command, which
is now 9 lines long and includes
	- an entirely superfluous :
	- five lines of copyright notice (so don't y'all go
	  trying to use empty files any more; AT&T owns the
 	  copyright)
	- a #ident--which, of course, is meaningless to the
	  shell, but reveals the interesting fact that we're
	  now up to version 2.3 of a formerly-empty file

However, the preceding was only for illustration anyway.
Nobody wants a dirty old shell script for the null command;
it should of course be a C program for efficiency.  So here
we have the first cut at IEFBR14.c:
	main()
	{
	}
This also serves only for illustration; it is historically
accurate in that it contains the same bug as IBM's original
IEFBR14.  (It may be of some interest that IEFBR14 proved
the old CS aphorism "Every program contains at least one bug
and can be shortened by one instruction" at the inductive
limit: It was a single instruction which didn't work...but I
digress...)  Here's the first correction:
	main()
	{
		exit(0);
	}
But to make this proper in today's brave new world, we need
<stdlib.h>.  Also, for formality's sake and international
propriety, we should add the normally-obligatory setlocale()
call (actually not necessary--this may be the *only* program
for which that's true--but it's hard to pass up poking fun
at a requirement to set a default explicitly), and this in
turn requires <locale.h>.  OK, so here's the penultimate
version of IEFBR14.c, our properly ANSI and
internationalized (unless I screwed up) program-to-
do-nothing:

	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <locale.h>

	#ifndef	lint
	static char *sccsid = "%W% - %E%";
	#endif

	/*ARGSUSED*/
	main(argc,argv)
	int	argc;
	char	**argv;
	{
		setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
		exit(0);
	}

To create the final version, all you need is your local
Draconian corporate screenful of copyright notice and
disclaimer.

ECC is more painful in all the above ways, and tends to be

parity is amply sufficient.  It's nice to be able to repair

most systems crash more often than that for other reasons

UNIX is a scrawny kid from New Jersey who became something

Mach tries to turn modern UNIX into RoboCop; POSIX is an
attempt to make UNIX more attractive to corporate America

An amusing little dialog I just had with the "leave"

  leave: You are not logged in

Huh?  I'm not?  Better check:

  > f
  Login       Name              TTY Idle    When    Where
  ts          TS                 co   41 Mon 16:43

    Sure looks like I am logged in.  Admittedly, I am using
the "uw" program, so perhaps "leave" isn't able to unravel
the maze of ptys, ttys and processes that "uw" creates.
(Using "uw" is kind of like using "x", except completely
different.)  Isn't it great that unix process/terminal

   So, what's wrong with that?  running a shell script
   forks off another shell, and when it terminates, you are
   returned to where your parent shell left you.  If you
   want to end up in another directory, use an alias.

The elegant approach is for the subshell to open /dev/mem
and change the directory of its parent process
directly. Another popular approach is for both shells to
open connections to the X server, select for property notify
events on screen 0, and negotiate an incremental selection
transfer in a manner acceptable to both the parent process,
child process, and the X Consortium Office of Management and
Budget, falling back on the system wide default directory
(which you must be running automounter to access) in case
the server returns a BadAlloc error.

    Oh yeah, in case you were wondering how to open an X
connection from the shell, you have to be running
"xperlsh".  But since it runs your .xperlshrc file through
the C preprocessor first, you have to make sure you have an
ANSII cpp in your path supporting ## style macro
concatination, but other than that it's pretty much like you
would expect. 

(But of course you have to set your path up right first, so
you need to set the "SkipAheadOnErrorsAndTryAgainSomeOtherTime" 
option to xperlsh in your .xperlshinit file, which is
sourced by your session manager (so naturally you have to
restart the window system before it takes effect.).)

	 Your Next Visit To The Proctologist Will Be!


    So I was playing XTetris, and I got to thinking,
wouldn't a two-player version of this be cool to have, like
the one on the Explorers.  So I glance at the code; it's
pretty modular, shouldn't be too hard.

    And I've got the thing in my head, it's all nice and
organized and clean and beautiful: there's this top level
constraint frame, with some children which are buttons and
status and so on, and a pair of other children which are
tetris playfield widgets.  Ok, the code's using global
variables for everything, but it'll be simple to just make
those slots in the playfield structure.  Fine.

    So like I said, I've got this pretty little hierarchy in
my head, I could draw it on paper in ten pen strokes, I
could write an Explorer program to toss the windows on the
screen in the appropriate relationships in like a minute.

    So I go and look at XBiff, another program I've screwed
around with a lot, to remind myself of the customary way to
do this shite under X.  Well, that comes down to two .h files
and one .c file for each widget-type; a lot of fooling
around with global arrays which the resource manager uses in
some seriously arcane way; and a whole lot of smelly glue to
hold the whole thing together, in the form of
FunctionsWithReallyLongNamesWithMixedCaseSoThatWordBased-
CommandsAreUselessToYou.

    I start getting intimidated by this, and then I remember
that we've got this interface builder thing called XDesigner
(that I think we actually paid money for).  Well, I've seen
people use it, and it lets you specify all kinds of
constraints and shite, and then generates C code.  The code
it generates looks like hell, uses lots of global variables
and gensymed names, but at least it generates the calls you
need to make.  I think.

    Well simple and intuitive are two words which spring
immediately away from mind when using this program.  After
ten minutes of using the monster, my fingernails were
starting to bleed, and there were these strange mouse-grey
plastic growths peeling their way through the back of my
hand, just like the flesh-gun in Videodrome, so I gave up,
deciding that doing it by hand would be easier.  Thirty more
seconds of that and I was considering starting up XDesigner
again.

    At this point I reached enlightenment: first a flame,
and then I go to read some comic books, putting thoughts of
"recreational" X hacking as far behind me as possible.

Subject: Mail Problems

    The mail spool directory got screwed up sometime during
the night so that mail files were renamed to the names of
other users (i.e., the name table was somehow permuted).
Then the mailer continued delivering mail, placing mail to
the user whose name was (improperly) on the file in that
file, so that there were some messages to one user, and some
messages to another user in some files.  This doesn't apply
in all cases; many people did not receive mail after the
screw-up and before the fix, for example.

    What we have done is rename the files to the name of the
original owner.  In most cases this solves the entire
problem; but for people who received mail this morning, it
doesn't -- your mail of this morning is in somebody else's
mail file.

    We cannot fix this.  But we can tell you who this other
person is, and whose mail is at the end of your mail file.
Then you can forward it to the person in question, or prompt
the other person to send you the mail.

    You know, I can't easily imagine how Unix manages to

I mean, if it walked over a table of pointers to filenames,
why aren't the filenames just random trash?  Of course, I
have successfully protected myself from learning about the
data structures used in the Unix file system, so I can only
conjecture here.

    I asked Ian, who knows something about the data

watching people complain about bugs which were fixed when I

    For example, and this may be totally inaccurate since I
have avoided leaning what's going on with unix these days,
but from the descriptions I've heard, it seems that the
interlocking on the aliases database has been intentionally
removed because it takes a long time to recompile the

    So we just turn off the interlocking and let the

certainly do disappear regularly at tla-arg, but only for a
few minutes at a time.

    What I find totally incredible is that the general level
of systems seems to be lower in almost every respect than it
was ten years ago -- the exception being that the machines
run ten times faster.  (Well, mine doesn't; it's a straight
3600 and thoroughly canine.  But everyone else's does.)

    I maintain a couple of large mailing lists, one of which
has a nine-year history.  Nine years ago it ran perfectly on
ITS, and then for another five years on OZ.  Then we moved
it to Reagan (a bolix) which really didn't work well, but
was tolerable, but got more and more broken.  We've left it
there, despite lost mail and infinite maintenance
aggravation because *we can't find any machine that we have
access to that has more reliable mailing list service*.

    ``We'' here is a group of five mildly famous AI PhDs at
five different labs, each among the most famous in the
world.

    I have some friends who work at Anon MPCSL.  MPCSL is
probably the most prestigious computer science laboratory in
the world.  It is the place where LANs and printers and
email and such were made practical (if not invented).  They
run Sun unix now, and it is totally broken, and no one can
fix it.  Their expensive PhD researchers regularly waste
*days* trying to get files to come out of a printer or
sitting around waiting for NFS to get fixed so their machine
will unwedge.  It's officially acknowledged both that this
is a disaster and that it won't get fixed.

    Along with the degraded level of systems support has
come an extraordinary decrease in access that might let one
fix things for one's self.  When I was 17, in 1978, I was a
``tourist'' at the MIT AI lab -- in other words, I used
their PDP-10 although I had no affiliation whatsoever with
the lab.  When the system crashed, I would wander into the
machine room, figure out what had gone wrong, and toggle the
relevant boot sequence into the front panel of this $1e6
mainframe.

    Here in the future, at most CS labs, you can't get
access to the machine room no matter who you are.  If the
file server goes down at 5:01 Friday afternoon, it stays
down until 9:00 Monday when the authorized person comes in.
So a lot of famous expensive computer science PhDs, many of
them capable of designing the file server in their sleep,
grunt in disgust and go home and get nothing done for the
weekend.

    I can't understand how this has been allowed to happen.
Besides being fantastically annoying for users, it's
fantastically wasteful for companies.  I can't understand
why the CEO of Anon doesn't say ``God DAMN it!  We are
going to have reliable mail service around here, or HEADS
ARE GOING TO ROLL!''  I can't understand why people don't
just fix things that are broken, the way they used to ten
years ago.  I just can't figure out how it can have gotten
this bad.

    I sometimes wonder whether the problem with Unix might
stem from the fact that it much of the post-Thompson/Ritchie
software was indeed designed by famous expensive computer
science PhD's (while they were under-paid and
over-caffienated graduate students).  Certainly, much of it
appears to have designed by people who, if they weren't
already asleep, ought to have been.

    We have progressed far from the days when Unix came on
two RK05's (10 Mb total for you children who weren't born
then), and the magic number in the boot sequence was passed
down in unbroken oral tradition from Ken to you.

    However, I'm not sure if all the progress has been in
the right direction.

    It's not the only part of the national infrastructure
that has been allowed to turn to rust, rot, and dust.  In my
more paranoid moments I think that it's all one big
conspiracy to soften us up by a sinister force.  It's a
little more subtle than bombing us back into the stone age,
but perhaps in the end has the same effect.  

    Unix in its current form can be tied to the CIA and Army
Intelligence through the Berkeley connection and the
intelligence community's covert experimentation with
administration of drugs to civilians.  These are the same
moments when I feel that every president from Nixon to Bush
has actually been an alien in a rubber full-head mask.  No
genuine, human, American president would do the stuff they
do.

    I've seen quite a number of allusions to some downward
fall of unix even in this forum.  Let's get this straight
once an for all: Unix was flawed from conception.  Its
entire New-Jerseyist philosophy is flawed.  In fact, its
entire "philosophy" is a Source of Evil in the Modern World.

    THERE WAS AND IS NO FALLING-OFF FROM A WORLD OF
UNDIVIDED LIGHT.  THERE WAS NO GREAT PURE, PRIMORDIAL,
PRELAPSARIAN UNIX.  The Unix you see, with which you
struggle, which you curse, is not a diseased and reduced

    I think that there are a bunch of reasons for this.  In
"the good old days", things were smaller, administered by a
small number of very highly qualified people, and largely
confined to research.  

    Nowadays, all this stuff is "standardized" by committees
with divergent goals and widely varying talent and
knowledge, forced to be upward, downward, and sideways
compatible, is much larger, much more widely distributed,
implemented by people fresh out of college who've never
written a large program in their life and never will because
now they're doing their own little part of a "software
engineering" effort the totality of which they do not
understand and have never seen a good large system, in fact
have never seen or tried to understand all of any large
system whatsoever.

    Right.  Well there's this weird professionalization of
computing facilities going on, perhaps because unix is a
sort of scared text which you have to study continuously to
understand.  That professionalization has the inevitable
result that you won't be able to fix things yourself when
they break.  

    That's why I use a macintosh now.  I use it partly
because it has a good lisp, etc., but largely for the
specific reason that other people don't use it.  My lab has
200 people in it.  Either (a) lots of people hack the system
or (b) they don't.  

    In case (a), most of them won't know what they're doing
because for the most part we don't hire people because
they're hackers anymore and we actively discourage them from
becoming hackers when they get here.  Having 200 people
wantonly hacking unix would be really bad.  So with
alternative b, a lot of things don't get done because things
are just so much more complex than they used to be (e.g. we
now have so many disk drives that statistically one should
fail every two weeks, thus causing major pains).

    So I use a mac.  There are lots of things I can't do
with it and so I log into unix for that.  But on the other
hand, things are simpler, more stable, there is a smaller
user community, and I'm the only one changing things so I
know what's going on and whose fault it is when something
breaks.

Subject: Fun With "make"

    Recently I was working on a fairly small program in C.
It took about two or three hours to write and test.  I had
been trying to push for higher standards in the group I was
working with (some users tended to avoid using any of the
development tools), so even though there was only one source
file involved I wrote a makefile.  Also in the interest of
promoting standards I wrote a manual page for it.

    Local man page files end in ".l" 

    This is more than just a convention.  Man not only
insists that these files be located in the right directory
but they must have the correct extension or they will not be
displayed.  After I finished the man page I figured it was
time to install the program.  Just to make sure everything
was ok I ran "make clean" followed by "make".  

    The man page file was newer than the C source code file
so make dutifully fired off a lex job to update the .c file,
blowing away the morning's work.  It is always nice to have
default rules for creating source files in case you forget
how to do it yourself.

   $ make
   rm -f tickfix.c
   lex  -t tickfix.l > tickfix.c
   "tickfix.l", line 1: syntax error
   ...

P.S.  It is probably worth noting that the first time I
started to write this note I was interrupted by the message:

    Panic: Assertion failed  

and got to wait 10 minutes for my Sun to reboot before I
could continue.

    Dear DC-

    Your message to unix-haters of Tue, 24 Sep 1991
    14:15:45 PDT was forwarded to all members of the
    computer research staff at MPCSL.  I thought I would
    send you some comments.  I have been a UNIX-hater for
    15 years, which is how long I have been at MPCSL.  I
    avoided the UNIX revolution until it was recently
    foisted on me.  At MPCSL, we formerly had three
    completely incompatible programming environments:
    InterLISP, Smalltalk, and Cedar.  This was viewed by
    the new powers as very bad and in need of fixing.  So
    we moved to commercial UNIX-based platforms.  So now we
    have about 30 incompatible systems (text editors and
    formatters, mail systems, versions of the OS, file
    formats, programming languages, window systems, window
    managers, toolkits, ... ). instead of three, with more
    being added every day.  Top this with the incredible
    morass that is SunOS and it is no wonder that you are
    wondering.

    Up until recently, we owned everything from the
    hardware to the microcode to the applications.  We
    could fix anything that broke at any level; we could
    evolve wonderful new systems.  How do we "fix" the X11
    releases or the SMTP protocol or SunRPC??

    In my opinion, things got the way they are because
    market forces completely overwhelmed technological
    forces.  Because UNIX was free (or nominally licensed)
    it came into wide use, first in CS and EE departments
    and later in the world. To some, moving from MS-DOS or
    worse, it seemed like a win.  To those of us who have
    been around for a while and are aware of the
    alternatives, it seemed like a nightmare.  We thought
    it would go away when users came to their senses.  We
    were naive.  Sigh.  Meanwhile, thanks to BSD, UNIX grew
    like Topsy, or more like barnacles encrusting a sunken
    ship.  Ultimately, UNIX began to be viewed by decision
    makers who were not technically competent as a panacea
    for competing technologies.

    To take your example literally, the reason that Head
    Guy, CEO of Anon, doesn't say ``God DAMN it!  We are
    going to have reliable mail service around here, or
    HEADS ARE GOING TO ROLL!''  is that HE HAS RELIABLE
    MAIL SERVICE.  Anon mail is based on the RELA protocol
    suite and it runs on the Anon corporate internet; SMTP
    mail is handled at the periphery of the corporate
    internet by gateways, tortuously written and maintained
    by wizards.  Head doesn't know or care that UNIX is
    lurking underneath all this.  At MPCSL we have had
    reliable mail for years, based first on the Grapevine
    mail transport and storage system and then, more
    recently, on RELAMail.

    I have requested to join unix-haters.  I look forward
    to more exchanges on this mailing list.

Subject: The elegance and simplicity of leaving things out


    I spent the better part of this afternoon trying to link
a program together.  Linking with the cc command (the only
"correct" way to link a C program) produced some complaint
about not being able to find a function I'd never heard of,
some __sbuf kind of thing (the exact name escapes me).  Now,
the program I was trying to link isn't mine; it's quite old,
and while not very large, was written in a modular fashion,
so there are quite a number of files involved.

    You'd think that tracking this down would be quick and
easy.  On any 1960's system, you'd simply get a linker map,
and immediately learn where the references to __name were
occuring.  (Actually, many linkers would tell you as part of
the error message.)  Given that, a quick look at the
offending code would usually be enough to resolve the issue.

    Unix, however, believes in the "one tool, one job"
philosophy.  A linker should link.  (So why do I call the C
compiler to link my program?  Oh, well.)  Producing a link
map is a job best left to someone else.  For that matter,
even producing an intelligible error message is best left to
someone else.

    Unfortunately, that someone's never made an appearance.
Maybe next year, after X support is done.

    The problem?  Turned out the system, which is generally
carefully written, still had to run on Unix, so did have to
descend to some of standard Unix techniques - like assuming
that, if it referred to _sbuf, it would get access to a
particular object within the guts of the implementation of
the standard I/O package.  At the time the code was written
(Unix V7 and even earlier), not only was this the right
name, but this was the only way to accomplish the prosaic
task of making sure that output to stdout was fully
buffered.  These days, _sbuf no long exists, or its name has
changed, or something.

    Now, if I'd used one of those horrible old '60's systems
- or even many modern operating systems - I would have found
all this out from my link maps or error messages within a
couple of minutes.  Then I would have had to spend the
afternoon debugging the Segmentation Fault that followed
once I got past this roadblock.  It should be obvious to
everyone that the Unix philosophy of staying small and
simple has shown its true value again: Clearly, the _sbuf
bug was much smaller, simpler, and more elegant than a nasty
Segmentation Fault.  Much better that I spend the afternoon
on the former than the latter.

    Oh, yes: If the same program is linked directly with ld,
instead of with cc, no error message at all results.  Right
tool for the job?  Well, no; when you try to run the
resulting program, it bombs immediately with a bus error.
(Gee, are those buses really so unrealiable?)

    Emulating it, its bastard child, the Yellow Pages, is a
major source of lossage.

    It seems that when a site cannot talk to its nameserver
(e.g. because the network is down, some intervening computer
is down is down, or the nameserver computer is wedged
somehow or not running the server) that the yellow pages
gets completely wedged.  Then lookup of hostnames,
usernames, mail aliases, and so on hangs *forever*.  The
underlying problem is that the cretinous yellow-pages server
doesn't have a timeout when trying to use the domain system
for host name lookup, so it gets wedged forever.

    I discovered this quite dramatically when my slip line
died the other day and I happened to try rebooting during
the outage.  You can't start many of the daemons either so
you never come up!

Subject: (void*)0 



To: X3J16 committee
Message x3j16-all-111


Regarding (void*)0

To Bjarne, a thank-you for that gentle reprimand.  I
apologize for making unwarranted assumptions.  I shall try
to state clearly what I do know, and to ask intelligent
questions for the rest.

Bjarne's note provided some interesting technical
clarifications.  I happen to agree with the request at the
end of Bjarne's note:


| I think that we also need to look into
| 
| 	X* p = ~-1;
| 
| and its cousins to see if they could be disallowed, thus
| bringing C++ into the 80es. Naturally, disallowing
| 
| 	X* p = ~-1;
| 
| would be a C/C++ incompatibility and the issue would be to
| determine if it was gratuitous.

I think there is some uncertainty in C as to whether the
definition of "null pointer constant" can require that
constant-folding take place prior to syntactic type
identification, but no formal interpretation has been
requested to J11.  I will say this: I am quite willing to
defend to the C committees a change in C++ from "constant
expression that evaluates to zero" to "integral constant
whose value is zero".  This incompatibility can at least be
defended upon the grounds of infrequent usage, if none
other.

Having said this, I still think that it is worth discussing
the status of
  X* p = (void*)0;
or, as it more frequently appears in C, of
  X *p = NULL;

Bjarne's note gives a consistency argument for disallowing p
= (void*)0:

| It would add yet another wart to the language that the
| compiler would have to test for. It is a fundamental rule of
| all typed languages that the legality of an expression is
| checked based on it type and not its value. C violates this
| by allowing constructs such as
| 
| 	X* p = ~-1;
| 
| while disallowing
| 
| 	X* p = 1;

One might add that allowing p = 0 is also allowed based upon
the value and not the type, but it is, admittedly, much less
"warty" than p = ~-1 .  Given then that we cannot reduce the
"wart count" completely to zero, might we not at least
consider eliminating the p = ~-1 wart (which, to my
knowledge, no one uses) while allowing p = (void*)0 (which,
I believe, is often used in C).

While the syntactic details can be fairly simply stated, the
overall configuration issues are not simple.  Nor are the
issues raised by the interactions between (a) existing
bodies of application code, (b) existing libraries for C,
and (c) C++ implementations.  Here is a brief survey of the
problem:

Many existing bodies of C applications use the macro NULL,
defined in <stdio.h> and other headers.  A strictly
conforming C program assumes that NULL may be defined in the
C-vendor's headers as 0, 0L, or (void*)0.  It is the
responsibility of the library vendor to provide the
definition for NULL which will properly reflect the demands
of the underlying hardware, software, and library.  As Tom
MacDonald has pointed out, there are some architectures in
which (void*)0 has a representation different from either 0
or 0L.  More commonly, on segmented architectures such the
80x86, there is the (lamentable) dependence of the size of
pointers upon the memory model which is selected at compile
time.  To be sure, in many architectures this dependence can
be circumvented in the C-vendor's header by old-fashioned C
conditional-compilation techniques such as
  #if _VENDOR_FLAG_FOR_SMALL_POINTERS
  #define NULL 0
  #else
  #define NULL 0L
  #endif
This technique, however, makes the program dependent upon
conditional compilation; the source after translation by the
preprocessor is no longer portable source.  And not all
architectures will support this technique.

Attempting to eliminate the conditional-compilation with a
constant expression such as
  (_VENDOR_FLAG_FOR_SMALL_POINTERS ? 0 : 0L)  // misleading!
will, of course, fail because the int 0 is promoted to long
0 inside the conditional.

Thus, for these and other reasons, many C vendors have
chosen to use (void*)0 as the definition for the macro NULL.

This creates the strange situation in which the user's
strictly-conforming C program is invalid in C++ because of a
decision made by the C-library vendor.  For a specific
example:

#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	if (argv[1] == NULL)
		return 0;
	else
		return 1;
}

This program is valid in C++ if NULL is 0 or 0L, and invalid
if NULL is (void*)0 .

Such simple examples, however, do not get to the heart of
the problem, namely "ellipsis" functions.

In order to be valid as C++, a C program must provide
prototypes for all function calls.  This is essential for
type-safety and will not be further justified here.  This
means that (actual) argument values being passed to (formal)
parameter types specified by prototypes will be properly
converted to the expected parameter type.  C programs used
to need the name NULL for passing the null-pointer value to
pointer arguments of un-prototyped functions.  This need is
eliminated in C++.  Now the only use for a null-pointer
symbol is for calling an ellipsis function.  Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
void prp(void* p1, ...)
{
	va_list ap;
	void* p;
	int i = 0;
	va_start(ap, p1);
	p = p1;
	while (p != 0)
		{
		printf("pointer #%d = %p\n", i, p);
		++i;
		p = va_arg(ap, void*);
		}
	va_end(ap);
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	prp(argv[0], NULL);
	return 0;
}

If the manager responsible for maintaining existing C simply
replaces all uses of NULL with integer 0's, he or she will
introduce a portability bug into the strictly-conforming
example shown above.

However, this just scratches the surface of the problem.  It
is not my intention to be an apologist for all the
historical warts of "old C".  There are a number of good
reasons why the old typical uses of NULL should be
discouraged.

First of all, ellipsis functions are themselves a hole in
type-safety.  For this reason alone, it is commonly
suggested that the programmer should consider eliminating
the definition or use of an ellipsis function.

Secondly, and more serious in this context, many of the uses
of NULL in conjunction with ellipsis functions actually
created undefined behaviors even in ANSI C.  Here is the
problem: If the type specified on the va_arg invocation is
not "compatible" with the type of the actual next argument
(after promotions), the behavior is undefined.  In ANSI C
the types char* and void* are required to have the "same
representation", but they are not "compatible" types.  And
the integer value 0 (or 0L) certainly is not of compatible
type to any pointer.  Therefore, many of the common uses of
NULL to terminate variable-length lists of pointers will be
passing values that create undefined behaviors.  With the
example function prp shown above, an undefined behavior
would result from invoking
  prp(argv[0], argv[1], NULL)
because argv[1] is a char* and va_arg is expecting a void* .
If the va_arg call is changed to look for a char* , then the
argument NULL itself produces an undefined behavior.

If a programmer really does need an ellipsis function that
accepts a varying number of pointers, one could suggest that
the proper way to terminate the argument list (either in C
or in C++) is to cast 0 to the same pointer type as the
other arguments; e.g.
  prp(argv[0], argv[1], (char*)0);
The va_arg invocations in the calling function should
specify the proper type for the pointer arguments, namely
char* in this case.  And only when all the arguments are of
type void* should the terminator be (void*)0 .

Having thus argued that NULL should not be used to terminate
pointer-argument lists for ellipsis functions (in either C
or C++), I would still suggest that this does not provide
justification for flagging p = (void*)0 or p == (void*)0 in
C++.

I am reminded by the email discussion that we must all keep
an open mind to alternative views.  Certainly there is much
interest in the arguments that might indicate that p =
(void*)0 presents a problem that is not present in p = 0 .
If, however, investigation determines that the real danger
is in passing (void*)0 to ellipsis functions, then we would
have the curious asymmetry that the current rules prohibit
  p = (void*)0;
and sometimes (depending upon definitions in headers)
prohibit
  p = NULL;
as compile-time syntax errors, but invocations where real
problems might lurk, such as
  prp(argv[0], argv[1], (void*)0);
or
  prp(argv[0], argv[1], NULL);
are not diagnosed.

I have taken the time to outline the question in this
fashion to indicate that there is a sincere and
well-intentioned question being addressed here.  Both the
original query and the subsequent discussion are really C
compatibility questions, so I would suggest that the
x3j16-compat reflector is the appropriate place for
subsequent discussion, but of course that is a judgement for
each contributor to make.

Subject: Risks of owning a modem

As you may notice from the header of this message, it is
about 2:30 A.M. on Saturday morning (or Friday night, if you
prefer).  I just got a knock on my door, which was
astounding in itself.  It turned out to be a couple of cops.
They asked me if I owned a certain phone number, which is
the one I use for my modem (and nothing else).  Apparently
it had dialed 911.  

In itself, this is nothing unusual.  I have seen similar
reports on RISKS before.  But my L.sys file has no number
containing the sequence 911!  A check of my uucp logs showed
successful calls at 2:01 and 2:08, followed by a failure at
2:23.  Presumably this last was the cause of the 911 call
(we have good police response times here).  There are two
numbers for the 2:23 call, both of which contain the
sequence "166".  Now how did that get turned into 911?
Maybe my dyslexic modem turned the digits upside down, then
got confused about what was repeated :-)?  Seems moderately
unlikely.

For what it's worth, it's a Telebit T-2500.  The cops said
it happens fairly often.  Personally, I'm upset.  Those guys
have better things to do than chase spurious calls from
modems.  But I have no idea what I can do to prevent a
recurrence.  I've only had the thing a couple of months.  I
sure hope this isn't a "feature".  If so, perhaps the police
department has a way for me to tell them to ignore 911 calls
on that line.

Having recently wasted an evening learning about a different

imagine how it can misbehave in almost arbitrary fashion.
The model I am familiar with comes with a manual that is

It doesn't run Unix, but it wouldn't suprise me if in a few
years you will be able to buy a modem that does.

SunLS leverages the expertise of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in
the UNIX(R) data storage marketplace.  Since its founding in
1983, Sun has consistently led the industry in integrating
computer equipment from multiple vendors into powerful data
storage engines.  Sun pioneered the concept of distributed
computing and networked filesystems, in which all of an
organization's diverse computer resources can be accessed
through the user's desktop workstation.  SunLS now builds
upon that expertise as it focuses on delivering the highest
quality listings of files and directories throughout
enterprise-wide networks.

SunLS offers a product for enterprise-wide, PC, and LAN/WAN
filesystem listings, as well as a product for local
filesystems.  Both flat and recursive listing options are
available.  The SunLS product is based on industry
standards, allowing customers to introduce the technology
into their existing systems, providing an upward migration
path to future technologies while protecting previous
computer investments.

To complement its product line, SunLS has initiated a
partnership program in which third-party vendors work with
SunLS to custom-tailor solutions to each customer's
particular requirements. The aim of the SunLS Partners
Program is to provide customers with the widest possible
range of choices.

"As a new business venture, SunLS has the agility,
entrepreneurial drive and market focus of a start-up," said
Scott McNealy, president and chief executive officer of Sun
Microsystems, Inc. "Yet with financial backing from
$3-billion Sun Microsystems, Inc., the company has the
resources -- including engineering, manufacturing, technical
support, sales and marketing -- to establish itself as the
undisputed leader in listing UNIX files."  Cheryl Vedoe,
vice president and general manager of SunLS, will have
responsibility for day-to-day operations of the
business. SunLS will maintain its headquarters in Mountain
View, Calif.

Thank you, but you have completely missed the point.  I
don't want to show people how whizzy the standard default
desktop environment is.  That's your job.

I want to give a talk about a quite different subject.  I
merely want to *use* the desktop environment to achieve my
own ends.  And as soon as I try to actually *use* it for
something instead of merely showing off the glitz, it falls
to pieces in my hands.  Unfortunately, this is becoming all
too common in Sun products these days, because we no longer
*use* the things we build for anything but whizzy demos.

Have you ever actually tried to *use* the desktop for
anything?  Like, say, printing a PostScript file?  The
answer has to be no - because dropping a PostScript file on
the print tool doesn't work.  Or binding a shell command to
a pattern?  Again no, because doing so depends on
undocumented features of /etc/filetype.  Even trying to
create a new icon from the standard set causes the icon
editor to dump core.  I'm not joking when I say that I've
been filing a bug report every couple of hours of trying to
use the desktop.  Its this kind of fragility that shows me
that I'm treading on fresh snow.  No-one else has walked
this way.

And that is a truly sad commentary on the state of Sun -
no-one has been this way because no-one believes that
there's anything worth doing over this way.  The reason Unix
was such an advance over previous operating systems was that
you could customize your environment in arbitrary ways.
With just a few shell scripts, for example.  Its just like
the cold war - in our anxiety to compete with the enemy
we've ended up losing the things that made our way of life
worth defending in the first place.  Like the freedom to
disagree with the authorities.

Testing whether people actually do customize their
environment is beside the point.  Of course they don't.  In
order to do it, I have to write C code using bizarre
features of Xview, exercise all my shell wizardry, and
dredge up undocumented features of the system from the
source.  And you're suprised when admins can't do this?  I
don't expect admins to do it.  But I do expect ISVs and
Sun's SEs to be able to do it, and right now they can't.



PS - I notice that someone filed a bug today pointing out
that even your example of dropping a mail message on CM
doesn't work if CM is closed.  That's a symptom of the kind
of arrogance that all the deskset tools seem to show -
they're so whizzy and important that they deserve acres of
screen real estate.  Why can't they just shut up and do
their job efficiently and inconspicuously?  Why do they have
to shove their bells and whistles in my face all the time?
They're like 50's American cars - huge and covered with
fins.  What I want is more like a BMW, small, efficient,
elegant and understated.  Your focus on the whizzy demos may
look great at trade shows, but who wants to have their tools
screaming at them for attention all the time?  It's like
having a Roy Lichtenstein painting on your bedroom wall.

My point is that the development groups of many companies
are not run like research labs, and the people who run them
do not typically have the same priorities with respect to
peer criticism and free speech and inquiry that people at
research labs do.  For example, I consider it very likely
that the Deskset product manager (if he or she knew what you
had done) would want very much to take action to ensure that
you or Mr. dshr couldn't embarrass the Deskset group and Sun
again.  It may be that this is impossible, due to the nature
of power relationships in the company.  It may be that,
because I raised the issue, people will be careful about
whom they forward the message to.  But for a marketing
weenie, the image of the product is what has to be
preserved, and bad press from someone who is supposed to be
playing for the same team is not going to be suffered
gladly.

I don't like the business-weenie culture; I think it's based
in the very lowest instincts and is part of what brings us
inferior products like the Chevy Vega and SunOS.  Maybe you
don't like it either, and so you might choose to ignore it.
Good for you.  But if my fortunes were ever to sink to such
a nadir that I found myself developing Unix(TM) software, it
would probably be because I needed the money really badly,
and I would be mightily pissed at you if I got hauled into

Subject: Words Fail Me Department

This isn't about unix.  Shoot me.

I've just waded through the programming manual for a
pipetting machine: that is, a machine that sits on a bio lab
bench and sucks and spits liquids.  The programming language
for this machine is, with the probable exception of ITS
TECO, the most bizarre I have ever seen.  A program is
called a method.  A method is divided into subroutines.  A
subroutine is divided into functions.  A method may not call
functions; a subroutine may not call a subroutine; a
function may not call anything.  So every program must have
exactly three levels of call depth!  

Where it really gets interesting is in its looping feature.
There are two looping functions, LOOP and NEXT, which
correspond to the beginning and end of a loop.  Now loops
can (and, for other reasons, almost always must) cross
subroutine boundaries.  So a method calls subroutine A,
which calls LOOP, does some stuff, and exits; then the
method calls subroutine B, which does some stuff and calls
NEXT.  So that makes control return to the step in
subroutine A just after the call on LOOP (after incrementing
the counter).  So we do the rest of A, return to the top
level, call B again, hit the NEXT, and jump back into A.

The following I quote from the manual:

``There is no harm done by using unmatched LOOPs or NEXTs.
  LOOPs establish conditions for the NEXT to test against,
  as well as establishing the point to pass control to.
  Since unmatched LOOPs have no NEXT, control is never
  passed back to the LOOP.  Thus, the extra LOOP is
  ignored, and the system proceeds with the following
  function.  Unmatched NEXTs have no conditions to test and
  always pass control to the following function.''

Words fail me.

    So I'm using this X window system on a UNIX system and
I'm (relatively) happy.  Then I switch to a X terminal and
I'm happier because my X terminal has no fan noise.  Then I
notice that my Gnu Emacs windows have this funny behavior:
the sub-shell command no longer seems to work.  Why not?
But if I start Emacs from an xterm window, it works fine.

    Ah, consistency, that's what I like about Unix,
consistency.  So then I do a little hackery and I discover
that the former Emacs processes have no "controlling
terminal" but that the later ones do.  Hey, now I'm getting
somewhere, but what the heck is a "controlling terminal"?
And how do I convince my Emacs processes to have one?

    Nothing in the man pages about controlling terminals.
There is a system call to remove a controlling terminal, but
none to add one, so writing a program is out.  Apparently,
this magic controlling terminal is inherited from the parent
process and thus the problem is that the window manager
process doesn't have one.  And the window manager process is
created by the .xsession file.  Next I decide to try having
the .xsession file create an xterm which will then execute
my startup csh which will then create the window manager and
then, finally, I'll have controlling terminals.  

    But I'm foiled again!  Apparently, the UNIX wizards have
decided that you can run the csh as an interactive process
or you can give it a command to execute, but you can't do
both.  I can't say "run this command (i.e., execute the
startup script) and then be interactive".  Argh!  Oh, but
wait, I forgot that one process can mutate into another one
using exec.  Let's try this incantation: "/bin/csh -c
'source .startup ; exec /bin/csh'" Yep, it works.  Now why
didn't I think of that in the first place?  Isn't it as
obvious as motherhood and apple pie?  And what the heck is a

This seems to imply that there are byte-order dependencies
in the protocol or something, which may be true, but an even
more incredibly frustrating aspect than that is that Suns
use an arbitrarily different talk protocol than anything
else!  Sun, in their infinite wisdom, decided to roll their
own, because why would anyone on a Sun want to talk to
someone who wasn't?  The network being the computer and all.

For a laugh, do "man 5 bar" -- another archive-file standard
that Sun is trying to foist on the world.  The format is
*exactly* like tar, except for like three differences:
there's a bit saying whether each file has been piped
through compress; there's a string saying whether this file
is a continuation of a multi-part archive; and they have
RANDOMLY PERMUTED the fields!!  Normal tar would be able to
read bar files, except for the fact that Sun decided to
reorder everything for no discernable reason.

Not that I don't think tar isn't a steaming pile of shite,
mind you.  The only good thing about tar is that it's not
shar.

This isn't strictly UNIX hate, but to the best of my
knowledge the only implementation of the talk protocol
(so-called) that compensates for the architecture (actually
byte-ordering) dependencies inherent in the protocols (see
below), and so can interoperate with all other talk
implementations, is written in Lisp, and does not run on
UNIX.

By the way, there's a revised (I hesitate to say "fixed")
version of the talk protocol that removes the byte-ordering
dependencies.  It's incompatible with the previous protocol,
and assumes that the OS on the other end is a BSD-derived
UNIX with the same "sockaddr" structure as is used in 4.3
BSD.  So here in the future, there are at least three
mutually incompatible versions of this standard.

It must be the users that are compatible, not the software.

Subject: I Have Seen The Future Of The Future And It Sucks Too.


So I figured I was better than your average unix-haters
reader since, hey, I hack Mach kernels; I'm not just
bitching about how bad things are, I'm actually doing
something about it, damn it!

Well, it all started with when my research version of Mach
went down in flames and took bits and pieces of the file
system with it.  In hindsight, I suppose I should have just
lived with things like not being able to print to certain
printers.  Well anyway, I had the Facilities people "add 10
megs or so to the root partition, oh and while you're at it,
why don't you rebuild the disk since the filesystem's been
kind of flaky since that, uh, big kernel crash last week..."

So anyway, I came in today and found a brand spankin new
filesystem.  All I had to do was replace the v2.5 production
kernel with a v3.0 research kernel.  Yep, just replace a
couple files on the root partition and reboot, no problem.

Well, it's a little more complicated than that.  For some
unknown reason, mach machines have a "root" directory ("/")
and a "superroot" directory ("/../..").  Once someone tried
to explain why but I didn't quite get it.

Anyway, you have to have hard links to your kernel file in
both root directories.  Then since mach is not a kernel but
a microkernel (the micro kernel binary with symbol tables,
debugger, etc is a svelte 950k on a MIPS box, unix emulation
is only another 1500k; I actually *needed* the extra 10 megs
on the root partition) you have to create a mach_servers
directory and populate it with various programs that mach
uses to emulate unix.

Now the tricky part is that since you have two root
directories you can put the mach_servers directory in the
root directory and then put a symlink in the superroot or
you can put the mach_servers directory in the superroot and
put a symlink in the root directory.  

The documentation says you can do it either way.
Unfortunately, the documentation doesn't say that it only
works when you put mach_servers in the superroot with a
symlink in root.  This also happened to be the second case
given in the documentation and I had the misfortune to use
the first case given in the documentation.  Silly me.

So I proceeded to boot my machine 10 or 12 times only to
crash into the kernel debugger every time.  I stared at
stack traces and read code and read code and stared at stack
traces.  The error messages were no help, they said "init
died".  Thanks a lot.

So I finally figured that one out and redid the mach_servers
directory and rebooted once more.  It crashed again at about
the same place complaining about "error 6000".  Now the
annoying thing about mach is that since your operating
system is spread out over 69 different address spaces, you
never really know for sure who is generating an error code.


You just have to memorize a mapping from error code ranges
to subsystems.  Eg errors in the 2500's are from the
device-independent device routines (go figure), -300's are
arg checking errors in an IPC stub routine, you get the
idea.  Well anyway, I never ran across 6000 before.  So I
hit the source code again...  Oh.  Error 6000 means some
file is not executable.  

One of those damn programs in mach_servers was trying to
exec another of those damn programs in mach_servers which
unfortunately didn't have it's execute bit set so naturally
the exec function, in it's penultimate moment of existence,
exclaimed "6000!"  before it crashed the whole show.

I guess the moral is that Mach looks like unix on the
outside but does totally different stuff internally.
However, when you strip away the tasks, threads, ports,
messages, and memory objects, when you get down to the very
essence of the system, the thing is still unix.  There is no
hope.

No, I think you've missed the full horror of the situation.
You see, Sun is shipping THE SAME CODE that Berkeley foisted
off on the computing world.  The "Berkeley droids", to
borrow a term, who wrote this code screwed up in the
standard Unix way (not only is everything Unix, but it's all
exactly the same as this-here paperweight on my desk).
Later on, Berkeley "fixed" their mistake by propagating
another implementation of the program that's incompatible
with both the big-endian and little-endian versions of their
previous mistake.  The upshot is that few of the commercial
UNIX vendors are willing to be gratuitously incompatible
with their previous releases, so they remain gratuitously
incompatible with other hardware AND the latest, most
grate-like software from Berkeley.

When, in a fit of insanity from which I have only recently
recovered, I wrote the aforementioned Lisp implementation of
this crud, I was able with only slight mental effort to
write code that not only interoperates with all three
versions of Berkeley's insane mutterings, but I was also
able to do it without any burden on the users.  I can
understand why this wasn't done in the UNIX implementations,
though: UNIX programmers expend so much effort being
compatible with their environment, they can be forgiven for
not having much energy left for writing responsible
software.

This is all another proof of Brooks' Law: You *will* write a
throw-away implementation; you *may* choose to ship it.

[By the way, and not to contradict my good friend from
 tech^2, in *my* part of the east coast we use an
 interactive-message protocol that thinks it's a sneaker; if
 it weren't for a propensity to try to talk to Texas every
 other time I send a message down the hall, I'd be happy.  Of
 course, we also use computers that don't force us to use
 punctuation characters as a substitute for the typographical
 variations that Gutenberg invented, back at the end of a
 previous Dark Age.]

    For a laugh, do "man 5 bar" -- another archive-file

        The following announcement was made October 29, 1991 by
        SunSoft, a Sun Microsystems, Inc. subsidiary.


SUNSOFT AND HP TO DEVELOP FOUNDATION PLATFORM FOR
DISTRIBUTED OBJECT APPLICATIONS

Both Companies Endorse OMG Object Request Broker

NEW YORK -- Oct. 29, 1991 -- Two of the world's leading
vendors of distributed computing solutions, Hewlett-Packard
Company and SunSoft Inc., today announced a program to
implement and license an object-oriented application
framework that will accelerate the growth of distributed
computing. This application framework will allow third-party
software developers to build next-generation distributed
applications.
		
The announcement today continues a joint-development pact
announced by SunSoft and HP in February 1991. At that time,
the companies submitted a Distributed Object Management
Facility (DOMF) to the Object Management Group (OMG), a
standards organization founded to promote the theory and
practice of object-management technology in the development
of software. In a related announcement today, the OMG
announced its standard specification for the Object Request
Broker (ORB), which includes the merged submissions of HP,
SunSoft, NCR, Object Design, HyperDesk and DEC and
incorporates the DOMF functionality.
	
The ORB is a mechanism by which objects transparently make
requests and receive responses across a network. For
example, two financial analysts in different countries could
simultaneously view and interact with a spreadsheet
object. SunSoft and HP are scheduled to offer to
original-equipment manufacturers (OEMs) a 100 percent OMG
ORB-compliant DOMF product in the second half of 1992. This
functionality also will be included with HP's systems
products and with SunSoft's Solaris distributed computing
solution. Early access source code is scheduled to be
offered to OEMs for initial porting work in the second
quarter of 1992.
	
"A key goal in the HP/SunSoft collaboration is to preserve
user investment in existing software" said Robert
J. Frankenberg, HP vice president and general manager of the
Personal Information Products Group. "The DOMF is designed
to work on a UNIX operating system or a non-UNIX system that
supports distributed operations. Customers don't have to
wait years for the development of totally new software
environments."
	
"The work of SunSoft, HP and others in conjunction with the
OMG has defined the industry's first standard for object
management on networks," said Steve MacKay, vice president
of user environment software at SunSoft. "Our continued
collaboration on an application frame work will bring object
technology to the volume marketplace faster than ever
anticipated."
	 
The application framework, which includes the DOMF, enables
the development and use of distributed applications. The
application framework will make platform differences and
networking issues transparent to users.  Software developers
will write to common interfaces rather than create different
implementations that are tied to the underlying system
software. This permits the creation of a single, highly
portable source code that can run on different vendors'
systems. For end users the application framework will
facilitate the integration of applications and data no
matter where they may be located on a network -- in the next
room or around the world.
	
"The beauty of this new solution is that it allows
interoperability without changing the system software,"
added MacKay. "Customers can invest in solutions like
Solaris and HP-UX today and know that they will support
distributed object applications as they become available."

Ease of use -- for application developers and end users --
is a prime focus of HP and SunSoft. This is achieved through
object-oriented technology, considered by experts to the
next significant advance in computing. Objects are modules
that contain data as well as instructions that work upon
that data. Object-oriented technology shields users from the
complex computer processes, such as the tasks a system must
perform to access information located on a different
network.
	
SunSoft, Inc., headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., is a subsidiary
of Sun Microsystems, Inc. The company is a leading worldwide supplier
of system software for distributed computing.  SunSoft's products are
targeted at software developers, system administrators and end users,
and are licensed by SunSoft and sold through major computer system
manufacturers and value-added resellers (VARs) worldwide.

Hewlett-Packard Company is an international manufacturer of
measurement and computation products and systems recognized
for excellence in quality and support. The company's
products and services are used in industry, business,
engineering, science, medicine and education in
approximately 100 countries. HP is a leading supplier of
object-oriented systems and software.  HP has 93,000
employees and had revenues of $13.2 billion in its 1990
fiscal year.

The most reasonable interpretation I can make of this is
that your sysadmin was absolutely correct, i.e. it really
*IS* true that the reason you can't telnet to MIT is because
it's in the wrong time zone.

That, at least, would be most consistent with our existing
corpus of Unix experience.

Why were you trying to telnet to a Unix system while you
were out to lunch?  Were you trying to dull your appetite?
If so, I urge caution.  The danger of embarassing yourself
by throwing up at the wrong moment is quite real.

WRT your sysadmin not being out to lunch, well, I can
sympathize.  I work through lunch quite often, and not by
choice either.  Sometimes I feel like Hans Brinker, with my
finger in the dike, keeping our organization from getting
completely inundated with Unix lossage.

This may actually be an indication of how long they expect
it will take them to get the product to market.  Perhaps by
the time they manage to start selling PowerOpen, they expect
the business and social cycles to have come back to the
point where they were in early 1986, and the name will
connote exactly the sort of ambition and power-lust -- I'm
sorry, I really meant to say hard-driving business acumen --
that will be fashionable again by then.

As part of my research on the Mach project at CMU, I've been
working on a program that generates names for future
versions of the unix operating system.  Version 0.1 of this
program will take a list of words and generate a random
permutation of those words.  Examples are as follows:

input> { power, open, open-systems, desktop }

output> 
open power desktop
open open-systems
power desktop
desktop open-systems
etc.

Perhaps I'll add kinder-gentler to the word list.  Maybe
kinder-gentler power desktop will be the unix of the
future...

The should also be a subtitle composed of a random
permutation of at least the following: "object-oriented",
"distributed", "parallel", "standards-compliant", "secure",
"user-friendly", "portable" and worst of all
"backward-compatible". The permutation should then be
suffixed with a string generated by the unixoid regular
expression "[A-Z]+-?IX".

So now we get things like:

open power desktop: a secure distributed portable HI-IX
desktop open-systems: a parallel standards-compliant
    user-friendly MOKIX.

Ah, yes.  The next version of the program will have

Subject: The Future Of Documents

I was reading about a new system (called HyTime) and ran
across a reference to a feature called a "projectr" [sic].
Later on I saw the following footnote:

 "The missing o is not a spelling error...[because] the
 Reference Concrete Syntax defined by ISO 8879-1986 allows
 a maximum of only eight characters for each identifier.
 Since the Reference Concrete Syntax constitutes the
 minimum set of requirements which all SGML systems must
 meet, all HyTime identifiers have been limited to eight
 characters for the sake of minimally conforming parsers."

Pretty non-non heinous.  So just because the designers of
SGML wanted to be able to award a certificate of merit to
boneheaded implementations that can't handle names longer
than EIGHT characters, anything built on top of SGML
inherits the same restriction.

Well maybe I can't blame this on Unix.  SGML itself comes
from IBM via ISO.  But the attitude is the same.  Grrr.

p.s. For what it's worth, SGML is the Standard Generalized
Markup Language, it is sort of like Scribe meets Ada; and
HyTime is suppoed to be a hypertext and multimedia package
on top of SGML, it was originally intended to be a standard
language for describing music, but the authors decided to
generalize it.  And the article is in the current CACM.

              John C Dvorak's Great Operating System Quiz 

Finding the right operating system is as simple as ordering
a pizza and answering some easy questions.

In the months (and perhaps years) ahead, many of us will be
confronted by a decision: What operating system to choose?
DOS? Unix? DOS with windows?

As I watch more and more users choose sides, it's apparent
that there are aspects of individual personalities that work
into the decision.  So I did some arduous research to
develop one of my famous tests to help people determine
which operating system is best for them.  I examine a
combination of both computing needs and personal habits.
Circle either the DOS, OS/2, W (for Windows), or Unix choice
next to your favorite answer.  Count up the number of
answers for each choice.  Whichever one dominates should be
the right operating system for you.  If there is a mismatch
of answers, then you should probably wait a year.

Dvorak's Operating System Quiz

1. What application do you expect to use the most?
 DOS) Spreadsheet
OS/2) Large complex database
   W) Solitaire
Unix) GREP

   W) Sweater and jeans.
Unix) Nerdy T-shirt, jeans, and no underpants.

5. What kind of music do you like?
 DOS) The Beatles
OS/2) Classical
   W) New Age fusion music
Unix) Tuba solos

6. What's your favorite color?
 DOS) Modern beige
OS/2) Blue
   W) Stark white
Unix) Pizza-stain red

7. What's your favorite car?
 DOS) Ford

Unix) a photo of Kim Basinger

15. (to be answered by women) If you were stuck on a desert island
    with only one man, whom would you choose?
 DOS) Kevin Costner
OS/2) Arnold Schwarzenegger
   W) Bill Gates
Unix) a photo of Kim Basinger

16. When you get up in the morning, what is the first thing you do?
 DOS) Shower
OS/2) Brush teeth
   W) Gargle
Unix) Pick off food stuck to body from sleeping with pizza

17. What's the last thing you do before going to bed?
 DOS) Let out cat, turn off lights
OS/2) Brush teeth
   W) Pray
Unix) Check to see if there is a pizza in the bed 


Tally your score and don't waste a minute finding pleasure
in the operating system that suits you best.  One disclaimer
I have to make: Anyone scoring 17 straight "Unix" answers
should seek counseling immediately.

Now the thing that I find incomprehensible is the notion
that a "signature" has become something it is anti-social

I've been sending and receiving electronic mail for -years-
and I've always felt that the "From:" field in the header
was perfectly adequate at identifying the author of a
message.  The ancients who designed the format of a header
(as set forth in the venerable RFC822) clearly intended that
the "From:" field would serve this purpose.  Witness the
fact that they also gave us "Sender:" and "Reply-To:", so
that "From:" could serve purely as author identification.

I would guess that the reason we now have people who are
unwilling to rely on the "From:" field to identify the
author of a message has a lot to do with the mail tools that
people have been given.  Tools that make it hard for the
author to control the contents of his "From:" field, tools
that alter its contents unnecessarily during transmission,
and tools that hide its contents from the recipient.  And
you all know which popular operating system promoted the
development of many of those tools...

Actually, the wonderful systems we have today screw you when
it comes to From lines on at least two levels.  Yes, as AB
points out, they provide you with no decent control and
bizarre and inappropriate rewriting.  But at an even lower
level, before the mailers even come into play, we have the
problem of user ids.  

In this day and age, when main memory comes in megabyte
chunks and disks in near-gigabyte chunks, and even CPU
cycles in the tens of millions every second, you'd think
that it would be possible to assign something at least very
much like real people names as user ids.

And on many systems you can.  On many systems you could 10,
20 years ago.  But that's not sufficiently "computerish".
No, we have the two brave holdouts: IBM systems, with their
8-letters-and-digits - and Unix, with their 8 letters that
no Unix system manager in the world even seems willing to
waste.  

Hey, those letters are VALUABLE.  Much better to assign
three-letter initials.  You can use the extra five bytes
you've saved on every account for something else.  Hmm,
maybe yet another X window manager.  Or another grep
variant.  (ggrep: Optimal when you want to search a few
files for each of hundreds of different strings.)

If three letters was good enough for dmr, it should be good

| HI,
| 
| Just thought that I would fill all of you in on a trip 
| that SS and I took to the Northeast Computer Show in 
| Boston this week.
| 
| Well S and I attended an IBM os/2 2.0 DEMO FROM HELL!
| 
| The presentation was supposed to be the latest OS/2 2.0
| Beta Code and they gave out registration cards for a free
| production copy when the shrink wrap product will be
| available in March or April.
| 
| First off, the room was seated for 88 people.  Only
| 15 showed up including 4 IBM sales staff and Steve and I.
| 
| The presenter extolled the virtues of the OS/2 protected
| operating system and how Windows with it's UAE problems
| was inferior. He then went through the most korny demo
| that I have ever experienced!  Some guy that looked like a
| cross between an athlete and Michael Jackson dancing
| around the screen pushing buttons and "saying join the fun
| of OS/2".  After this two people left the room, we are now
| down to 9 people.
| 
| He then demonstrated Lotus 123 for OS/2 and WordPerfect.
| He tried three times, unsuccessfully, to cut a selected
| area from the 123 spreadsheet into WordPerfect. On the
| fourth time he got half of the first line to paste into
| WordPerfect. What no DDE?
| 
| Next he went into how OS/2's full screen Windows emulation
| was better than Windows.  He clicked on the Icon and the
| system went into "Bit Heaven" and he had to do Atl-Esc to
| get back to the main PM Window.  He tried again with the
| same results.  He tried one more time and OS/2 crashed
| with a "TRAP ERROR".  He very quickly did the three finger
| salute and told the audience that this version of OS/2 had
| a new IPL feature that automatically rebooted OS/2 and put
| him back in his original environment.  Two of the
| attendees got verbally violent with the IBM staff.  We
| never had to ask a single question, the audience asked all
| the right ones for us.

Here's another great one:


38.  How can I write a generic macro to swap two values?

A: There is no good answer to this question.  If the values
     are integers, a well-known trick using exclusive-OR
     could perhaps be used, but it will not work for
     floating-point values or pointers, (and it will not
     work if the two values are the same variable, and the
     "obvious" supercompressed implementation for integral
     types a^=b^=a^=b is, strictly speaking, illegal due to
     multiple side- effects, and...).  If the macro is
     intended to be used on values of arbitrary type (the
     usual goal), it cannot use a temporary, since it does
     not know what type of temporary it needs, and standard
     C does not provide a typeof operator.

     The best all-around solution is probably to forget
     about using a macro, unless you don't mind passing in
     the type as a third argument.

This monthly posting is always good for a laugh.  (You've
got to laugh to keep from crying).  The following entry
needs no further comment:

40.  What's the best way to write a multi-statement cpp
macro?

A: The usual goal is to write a macro that can be invoked 
     as if it were a single function-call statement.  This
     means that the "caller" will be supplying the final
     semicolon, so the macro body should not.  The macro
     body cannot be a simple brace-delineated compound
     statement, because syntax errors would result if it
     were invoked (apparently as a single statement, but
     with a resultant extra semicolon) as the if branch of
     an if/else statement with an explicit else clause.

     The traditional solution is to use

          #define Func() do { \
                  /* declarations */ \
                  stmt1; \
                  stmt2; \
                  /* ... */ \
                  } while(0)      /* (no trailing ; ) */

     When the "caller" appends a semicolon, this expansion
     becomes a single statement regardless of context.  (An
     optimizing compiler will remove any "dead" tests or
     branches on the constant condition 0, although lint
     may complain.)

     If all of the statements in the intended macro are
     simple expressions, with no declarations or loops,
     another technique is to write a single, parenthesized
     expression using one or more comma operators.  (This
     technique also allows a value to be "returned.")

I doubt that, given that RMS had no particular unix
experience when he started FSF (which may explain a lot).
Given a background of ITS and Lisp Machines, I suspect unix
was chosen as the OS of choice because:

    1) Useful tools could be developed and used before the
       OS was ready.

    2) There was sufficient public domain and portable
       pieces of unix to serve as a place to start.

    3) replacing unix would be "better for the world" than
       replacing ITS.

RMS spent a lot of time before FSF trying to do basically
similar things with lisp machines.  No one noticed, no one
cared, and there aren't any more lisp machines anyway...

Subject: shut the f__k up

God damn it.  There's too much random noise on this list.
It sounds like some pathetic unix snoozegroup.

In the good old days, mailing lists came in two flavors.
There were real mailing lists, whose members used real
machines on the arpa net, and there were weenie mailing
lists, whose members used unix machines on some weenie net.
(This was only the moderately good old days.  When *I* was
young, there were only about ten machines in the world that
had mailing lists, and the concept of a mailing list that
went offsite hadn't really been worked out yet.  RD has a
lot to answer for.)

Anyway, the point is that people on real mailing lists were
expected to think for ten seconds, before they sent
something, to see if it was mindless blather or something
that other people might want to read.  This expectation is
lacking on weenie mailing lists.  It's rather like weenie
programming: most unix utilities have n extremely obvious
bugs that could be fixed with ten seconds of thought, but
there is no expectation that anyone will ever do this.

Here in the future the distinction between these two types
of mailing lists has been broken down, and the world is full
of blathering yammerheads.  It's much too late in general to
hold the line.

However, THIS MAILING LIST IS AN EXCEPTION.  

Unless what you are going to say is non-obvious, funny
enough that people will be unable to avoid laughing out loud
when they read it, and nasty enough to be labelled seriously
offensive, DON'T SEND IT HERE.

Got it?

Subject: Super-Duper Sigh


People were trying to figure out which remote login programs
they should install on one of the central UNIX servers at
the MIT AI lab.  They were trying to evaluate SUPDUP, and
they thought perhaps that it would read the .rhosts file and
maybe "crypt"ed login passwords and sent them across to the
remote login shell for better security.  The main system
hacker said he couldn't find the man page for it.

Sigh. So, I informed them:

   SUPDUP is the "super duper TELNET" protocol; its main
   feature is that is uses a more "intelligent" network
   virtual terminal model.  SUPDUP does not include any
   provisions for passwords.  It does not read the .rhosts
   file.

I pointed them at the RFCs, and also mentioned that they
could also just ask RMS about SUPDUP, but that I wouldn't
recommend bothering him about the password stuff too much.
Heh heh.

Well, anyway, one of the other system hackers wrote back to
me.  Here's his entire message; apparently this all he
understood about virtual terminal support:

   I'd call it a misfeature... it doesn't do a particularly
   good job; in particular, it breaks "vi".

I suppose I should have known better, but I wrote him back
one sentence suggesting that UNIX was what was in fact
broken.  Here is his reply.

   Well, one can argue this until one is blue in the face.
   However, supdup is just about the only terminal type
   that I have ever had problems with.
   
   In my experience, generic terminal emulations by the OS
   give noticeably poorer performance and are noticeably
   more buggy than the termcap/curses approach taken by
   UNIX.
   
   In short, I dislike supdup because it doesn't work
   reliably, not because I think generic terminals wouldn't
   be nice if someone got them to work properly.

I remember when, at that very same lab.... oh, never mind.
It's hopeless.

My recollection is that termcap was specifically designed to
support vi in the first place, and as a result is full of
incredible cruft that no other program in the world needs,
wants, or cares about.  It isn't too surprising that vi
might choke when deprived of its favorite magic cookies.

So much for off-the-wall flaming; here's a first-person
account.  When I wrote ELLE (which I'm using to compose this
message, by the way), I first tried to do the "unix thing"
by using termcap.  What a buggy crock.  Basically I never
found any terminal type that I couldn't support better
myself, and at least one never did work with termcap at all,
there being no way to describe the correct timings.  If I

Vi doesn't need supdup to break it, it starts out broken.
It sends a newline in order to move the cursor down one
line.  Well everyone knows that newline is really linefeed
so this should work, right?  Piece of shite operating
system.  I stopped trying to improve supdup on Unix at that
point.  It worked with emacs and I didn't want that other
thing anyway.

Speaking of supdup, a while back the people at the IETF
(that fine organization that brings you new Internet
protocols) started talking about adding some sort of local
editing protocol to telnet to reduce network delay and host
load.  So I suggested the supdup local editing protocol as a
good start (and even a good finish).  I was quickly told
that no, supdup was too complicated.  At least someone knew
what supdup was.  A draft came out a few months later.  Gee,
looked like they'd read the Unix TTY man page and written a
network spec about it.  Funny how this keeps happening.
Hardly less complicated than the supdup local editing

Subject: The Ultimate Unix Keyboard

Has anyone besides me noticed that Unix workstation keyboard
design is going backwards?  In particular, Sun's latest
keyboard, the Type-4, is a step backwards from the previous
design, the Type-3.  Give me the old keyboard of an MIT Lisp
Machine any day.

It makes me so mad; I have to use this abomination every
day.  I'm getting so fed up I could just...fix it!

And so I came up with...


		    A modest Sun keyboard proposal
			         SG
			    December 1991


Layout:

 +------------------------------------------+
 |					    |
 |					    |
 |      	+----+ +---+		    |
 |      	|    | |   |		    |
 |      	| L1 | | a |		    |
 |      	|    | |   |		    |
 |      	+----+ +---+		    |
 |					    |
 |					    |
 +------------------------------------------+


Features:

 o Compact layout good for laptops

 o Key placement easier to remember than Qwerty or Dvorak

 o Side-by-side arrangement won't strain the fingers when
   typing oft-used chords


Rationale:

I thought for a long time about offering two "L1" keys, one
on each side of the keyboard, to aid left-handers such as
myself.  However, I finally decided that would add
unnecessary complexity to what is otherwise a streamlined
design.  Also, it might be semanticly confusing, since the
"L" seems to stand for "Left."


As you can see, I've thought a lot about this design, and I
think it has all the features one needs when using a Sun.
Interested parties should contact me about licensing
arrangements.

From the annals of true life unix maintenance... Names have
been removed to protect the guilty.

       I located the following two problems (may be
       related) that were hogging <some.broken.unix.box>
       cpu time:

       1) For some reasons, /etc/sa (from crontab) had not
          been working for some time. /usr/adm/acct grew
          monstrously:

       -rw-r--r--  1 root     system   168637912 Jan  2 17:54 acct

        All attempts to process the info in acct dumped
        core so I made a copy of it in /bigtmp and emptied
        the file.  /etc/sa is now back to working as
        normal.

       2) Long, abnormal file names of "Macintosh style"
          broke the daily-cleanup script (run from crontab).
          For example, the gory:

    /bigtmp/ar/Music Backup/Music/People's Files/Romero/Grid/.resource

        Obviously Unix can't cope with such a naming
        system without some "protective wrapping" system.
        We need to take this into account if we continue
        to serve "Mc Files" from <some.broken.unix.box>.

        Guess I have re-write the daily-cleanup script (in
        perl?) but for now I've commented out the troubled
        commands.

       The load on <some.broken.unix.box> is now back to
       approximately 2.

We have two SUN machines side-by-side and networked to share

some prefer the other.  I compiled a program on the SUN-4,
incanted the magic saying to change its protection to

rash of mail messages saying "I tried to run your program

"Huh?" I said (momentarily forgetting that I was dealing

more can UNIX want?"  So I delved into the problem...
[details omitted, suffice it to say that it was ugly] ...and
it turned out that when you execute an execute-only SUN-4

No, goodness, no.  The error is 'read permission denied'.

We had an interesting experience this morning with `timed'
(a unix Network time daemon).  A vendor brought a
demonstration machine to a first-time unix user, who let the
vendor install it and boot it while it was connected to our
network.  The machine had a `timed' set up as a master.
When the vendor booted the machine, he did not set the time.

So, the first time one of our other machines on the net
asked for the time, this machine responded.  Soon all of our
machines thought that the date was 1/1/1970.  When this was
first noticed, our SysAdmins found the errant machine and
shut it down.  Unfortunately, the story doesn't end here.

It seems that there was also a bug in our 'real' `timed'
software, such that any date with more than 1 digit in the
day is not handled correctly.  So, the date went from 1/1/70
to 10/10/92 instantly.  This caused further havoc with
things like 'at' and all sorts of other unix utilities.

We're still picking up the pieces of our database (which
tracks things like work orders and trouble tickets, some of
which now have ages of 20+ years!).

Needless to say, we're working on a `reasonableness' check

Isn't it easier to enumerate the things they did get right
rather than the ones they got wrong?  Let's see.  I was
going to say using ascii instead of ebcdic, but I realize
now that doesn't quite work...

      [GNU sed]
      sure@buddy 138% sed -n -e n qux
      line 1
      line 3
      sure@buddy 139% sed -e n qux
      line 1
      line 2
      line 3
      line 4
      sure@buddy 140%

    IMHO, GNU sed got it right, but I'll never convince the
    world of that, and (primarily because) it makes my sed
    code non-portable.  <sigh>

Only less wrong, probably, but who wants to spend the time
to find out.

   |   The new xdvi performs anti aliasing on a grey-level
   |   display. I don't know what kind of display you are
   |   using, but on a color Sparc the output is much better
   |   than that of the previous monochrome version. Of
   |   course, drawing characters in color takes a little
   |   longer than in B/W.
   |
   |

   |Actually my display is a (logical) color display
   |attached to a microvax II.  But even given how slow a
   |microvax can be, this is slooooooww.  Pop down to 501
   |and I'll show you.  The output is also totally
   |unreadable.

   Give it a try on a SparcStation sometime. Everybody who
   saw the anti-aliased fonts on my screen really liked
   them; that's why I made it the default. Anti-aliased
   text on a SparcStation takes about twice as long (3
   seconds vs. 1.5 seconds for a full page), but given the
   very much superior output, that seems worth it.

					   Thomas.

The old version takes about 4 seconds to display a page on
my display.  The new version takes about 25 seconds.  And
you cannot read the result.  And magnification doesn't work
at all.  I'm sure it works great on a Sparc.  I'll bet that
the guy who wrote it was using a Sparc, that's why he never
saw these bugs.

But that's OK, as long as I know where the binary for the
old version can be found, I can protect myself from this
latest degradation in the environment.  Just another
instance of running as hard as I can to stay in the same
place.

(Oh yeah, did I mention that the "man page" no longer

Subject: The Horror. The Horror.


The following net discussion gave me a little case of the
titters, though I'm not sure exactly why. I think that it
has to do with the way it combines the typical unix "nice
try, but not quite right" feature with a classic unix fixed
size something or other, along with a wonderful totally
incomprehensible workaround which references a typical unix
ad hoc language (which itself is totally incomprehensible)!

Background: 

Unix shells have a feature whereby they allow shell scripts
(i.e. what some might call programs) to specify which
executable (i.e.  interpreter) to use on that script. The
mechanism requires the use of the magic string "#!" as the
first two characters of the script.

Story:

Some guy on some net group says:

  I've got some perl scripts that have #! lines like this:
     #!/usr/local/bin/perl -- # -*- Perl -*-
  or
     #!/usr/bin/perl -- # -*- Perl -*-

  The system tried to run /bin/sh on it instead of
  perl. I've heard of there being a length limit on the #!
  lines, but would that cause the line to be ignored? What
  would the limit be? Seems to me it should be a bug.

Some other guy responds:

  From "Programming Perl", by Larry Wall and Randal
  L. Schwartz (page 5, footnote):

  quotes on

  Note that many versions of UNIX will not allow an
  interpreter name to be longer than 32 characters.  If
                                     ^^
  your Perl pathname is longer than that (as it is in some
  instances of the Andrew File System), and if for some
  reason you can't get around that fact administratively,
  say this (including the comment):

  #!/bin/sh -- # A comment mentioning perl, to prevent looping.
  eval '/your/long/path/name/leading/to/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
    if 0;

  quotes off

Love that "if 0;".

I guess you haven't had the pleasure of booting a Unix

Some evil bits of software can just be killed.  With Unix,
the only way to be sure is to hold it down and drive a stake
through its heart.


Quoted from _Unix World_, November, 1989:

"The grim reality is that every life ends with a
 death. Funeral homes exist to make that fact a little more
 tolerable. ... UNIX can help here, too. The Gordon Funeral
 Chapel, for instance, does much of its accounting on an AT
 class, multiuser machine running XENIX. ...

 ... For example, Gordon says his system has to be able to
 classify two kinds of customer, "at-need," those who are
 actually deceased, and "pre-need," those who have made
 arrangements for funerals while still living. Moreover,
 the system has to be able to convert one kind of customer
 to the other as the need arises...."

Subject: Fun With cpp



I was doing a little computer graphics animation. It was to
be a potato masher going up and down, casting pretty shadows
on a table.  The rendering system I was using is "nice"
enough to run cpp on the file to give users the ability to
#define and what not. So, I figured that I would do
something like this:

----

#include "object_geometry"

#if FRAME==00000
translate 0 20 0
#endif
#if FRAME==00001
translate 0 19.8 0
#endif
#if FRAME==00002
translate 0 19.6 0
#endif
	.
	.
	.

#if FRAME==00100
translate 0 0 0
#endif

----

And I hacked the renderer code to throw cpp the proper
"-DFRAME=%05d" to spit out numbers the way I wanted
them. Why did I want the leading zeros? I don't know, I just
thought it was cleaner.

So I fired up the animation and let it run for a while
(days).

Well, the output was quite amusing (or at least it would
have been if I didn't need the results for my thesis defense
a week later). The object would go down for a few frames,
then jump up and go down a little, then go back to where it
maybe should have been, then jump up....

After a little headscratching, I realized that the leading
zeros in my frame numbers were causing cpp to treat them as
octal values. How precious.

But still, if I say "#define FRAME 00009" then "#if
FRAME==00009" should still fire (or it should at least whine
at me). Well, 00009==00009 does trigger, but so does
00009==00011.

Huh? 

Well, some C library thinks that the nine in 00009 isn't
octal, so it interprets it as 9 decimal. And 00011 is a fine
octal rep of 9 decimal.  So, both "#if FRAME==00009" and
"#if FRAME==00011" fired and I applied two translate calls
to my object geometry. And(!), it's not that having a
decimal digit makes the whole number decimal. The string
00019 gets interpreted as 00010 octal plus 9 decimal = 17
decimal.  Lovely, not.

Eventually, I tracked it down to the fragment

NOOOO...  We got bitten when we discovered that the bsd m4

Of course, I guess you could argue that unix is not a

The problem is that null is full.  Your void space is no
longer void, it's full up.

THE TOP TEN WAYS TO EMPTY AN OVERFLOWING BIT BUCKET:

10) Open the computer up. Look for the bit bucket, find the
    RED stopper at the bottom of it and open it up OVER a
    LARGE trashcan.
 9) Stop using the computer for 6 months, let the bits
    compost and continue.
 8) Take the ethernet terminator off, and "cat /dev/null >
    le0".  This spits the bits into the ether.
 7) When you write to /dev/null, the 0's don't take up any
    space, but the one's do.  Try writing a file full of 0's
    to /dev/null (binary 0, NOT ASCII 0 - ASCII 0 will start
    overfilling the partition).
 6) This is a common problem _only_ if you use the computer.
    If you stop using it, it won't have many problems as
    all.  Kick the other users off too.
 5) If you use lots of C programs, they have Null terminated
    strings that use up the bits in /dev/null.
 4) Bring the computer to Mr. Goodwrench, he will drain the
    bit bucket, change the oil and add windshield fluid, all
    in less than 29 minutes.  Now that's a deal.
 3) Consider upgrading to a byte bucket or even a word bucket.
 2) Since your already using Open Windows, open a window and
    toss the useless bits out the open window.
 1) Stop using the game "fortune" in your .logout script, Mr
    "Hacker".

    fact that Unix provides no documented portable way to
    find out your own host name (as a full domain-style
    name).

You speak of 'Un*x' as if was some complete and well formed
entity, particularly when it comes to networking (which was
only glommed on in recent history).

I just loved that what AT*T sold as the "Basic Networking
Utilities" package was UUCP!  Basic Networking, yeah right.
For g*ds sake, RFC1 is dated 1969, before Un*x was even
starting taking up disk space.

Funny thing about your subject line is that

	who am i | sed 's/\!.*//'

is almost certainly the most portable command line to return
the current hostname!!

Aw, shucks. This ain't hard. Y'all just fire up the "uname"
command.  Now, I can show ya how it works just fine
everywhere, 'cause I've got "RISC/OS" from Mips, the Unix
that does it all.

Watch:

  jtw@mercury>/sysv/usr/bin/uname -a
  mercury mercury 5.0-Beta RISCos mips

See, ya just take the first word, there, to get the machine
name.  I started with System V, cause I consider it
standard. But you can do the same thing on the new exciting
System V Release 4 from ATT-Sun, cause it's still standard,
so it'll still work!

  jtw@mercury>/svr4/usr/bin/uname -a
  RISCos mercury 5.0-Beta RISCos mips mips

Er, never mind. We'll go on to BSD.

  jtw@mercury>/bsd43/usr/bin/uname
  /bsd43/usr/bin/uname: Command not found.

Damn.

But anyway, now that you've got the hostname, you kin use
yer shell string contatenation operator to tie it in with
the domain name, which ya get with the domainname command,
of course. At least -that- works everywhere.

  jtw@mercury>/bin/domainname
  no_domainname_set

See? It's easy. If y'all need any further advice, just send
me mail.  No problem there, I'm right here at

You stupid ignorant fools.  Don't you know that the
official, blessed was of finding out your hostname in a
portable manner is to use the mailer?  It's very simple.
Here it is in the official ASSI C pseudocode:

   void crock *getmyhostnamedammit()
   }
   1.  Call mktemp to generate a unique string
   2.  Spawn a /bin/mail process to spawn a /usr/lib/sendmail process
       to mail the string as the subject line of a message to
       IHTFOS@sun.com (the machine exists, the login doesn't).
   3.  Busy wait until the mailer daemon reply containing the unique
       string appears in your mailbox.  The busy waiting should be
       done at a high scheduler priority so as to insure that you
       return from getmyhostnamedammit() as fast as possible.   
   4.  Extract the "To:" address in the mailer daemon reply.
   5.  Spawn a copy of /bin/ed to delete the message from the mail
       file.
   {

This routine will only very rarely destroy mail due to race
conditions.

This is a good, unix, tool-oriented approach which recycles
software rather than creating new software from scratch
(kind of like that scratchy toilet paper my housemate buys
at the co-op which says "save the forests" all over it).
Remember: Unix(tm) is the environmental operating system.

We should all show that we care for the environment by
writing lots of user programs which generate mail bounces
off of sun.com to determine their hostnames.  Then we should
all run them off of cron every minute or two.  In fact, we
could even modify the mailer itself to bounce off of sun.com
to determine its hostname.  Wouldn't that be spiffy?

Well here's another lovely UNIXism.  gethostname() is
supposed to return the "standard (ha!) host name for the
current processor."  gethostbyname() returns a structure
describing a host-table entry, of which one of the slots is
the "standard" (ha!) host name.

So you'd think that you could look at a host name and decide
whether it was one of the innumerable representations of the
name of the host you're running on simply by comparing the
results of gethostname() and gethostbyname(), wouldn't you?
F__K NO.  They apparently have nothing to do with each
other.

So if you have a program which really needs to behave
differently if it is displaying on the console monitor of
the machine it is running on because of pathetic limitations

The following opinion will probably get me kicked off this

I see nothing wrong with flaming about Unix lossage; if
anything, this mailing list acts as a support group for
those who are forced to live with Unix.  But once in a
while, why not actually do something *constructive* rather
than just complaining to the converted?  In particular, I'd
love to see a serious critique of Unix in the form of a
conference paper or journal paper with a title like
"Remaining Trouble Spots in Unix" or "Unix Considered
Harmful".  

The purpose of such an article would be to explain to the
rest of the world, in a very professional fashion, why Unix
inspires such unbridled negative reactions in the members of
this mailing list.  In particular, I would like to see such
an article separate, as much as possible, the fundamental

If there's one thing which truly pisses me off, it is the
attempt to pretend that there is anything vaguely "academic"
about this stuff.  I mean, can you think of anything closer
to hell on earth than a "conference" full of unix geeks
presenting their oh-so-rigourous "papers" on, say, "SMURFY:
An automatic cron-driven fsck-daemon"?

I don't see how being "professional" can help anything;
anybody with a vaguely professional (ie non-twinkie-addled)
attitude to producing robust software knows the emperor has
no clothes.  The problem is a generation of swine -- both
programmers and marketeers -- whose comparative view of unix
comes from the vale of MS-DOS and who are particularly
susceptible to the superficial dogma of the unix cult.
(They actually rather remind me of typical hyper-reactionary
Soviet emigres.)

These people are seemingly -incapable- of even believing
that not only is better possible, but that better could have
once existed in the world before driven out by worse.  Well,
perhaps they acknowledge that there might be room for some
incidental clean-ups, but nothing that the boys at Bell Labs
or Sun aren't about to deal with using C++ or Plan-9, or,
alternately, that the sacred Founding Fathers hadn't
expressed more perfectly in the original V7 writ (if only we
paid more heed to the true, original strains of the unix
creed!)
                                                   
       In particular, I would like to see such an article
   separate, as much as possible, the fundamental design
   flaws of Unix from the more incidental implementation
   bugs.

My perspective on this matter, and my "reading" of the
material which is the subject of this list, is that the two
are inseparable.  The "fundamental design flaw" of unix is
an -attitude-, and attitude that says that 70% is good
enough, that robustness is no virtue, that millions of users
and programmers should be hostage to the convenience or
laziness of a cadre of "systems programmers", that one's
time should be valued at nothing and that one's knowledge
should be regarded as provisional at best and expendable at
a moment's notice.

My view is that flaming about some cretin using a
fixed-sized buffer in some program like "uniq" says just as
much about unix as pointing out that this operating system
of the future has a process scheduler out of the dark ages
or a least-common-denominator filesystem (or IPCs or system
calls or anything else, it -doesn't matter-!)


The incidental -is- fundamental in dissecting unix, much as
it is in any close (say, literary or historical) reading.
Patterns of improbity and venality and outright failure are
revealed to us through any examination of the minutiae of
any implementation, especially when we remember that one
cornerstone of unix pietism is that any task is really no
more than the sum of its individual parts.  (Puny tools for
puny users.)




And speaking of revealing patterns of abuse through
observation of detail, has anybody considered that unix
geeks might be Adult Children or Survivors or be permanently
In Recovery?  Perhaps they were sodomised by an awk at a
young age, leading to a parodoxical attachment to the agent
of their humiliation?  If we could persuade them them to
spend all their time attending pop-psych workshops in the
woods ("Fire in the John"), beating drums and invoking the
shade of Dennis Ritchie, we could keep them away from their

This is to introduce ugh@uni.xha.te, for discussing the

All further discussions regarding the book will take place
on the ugh list, since unix-haters@tl must remain pure.

UGH is archived. Send mail to me or ugh@uni.xha.te for
changes. No, the "g" doesn't stand for anything, so quit
whining.  I must say, the response to the idea of doing a
book was overwhelming and uniformly supportive. Thanks,
folks!

Two important issues have come up: intellectual property and
money.  For the sake of discussion, anyone who sends mail to
ugh will be considered a "contributor". Old flames from past
unix-haters will NOT be reprinted without permission, unless
of course, the source is some cretin like Bill Joy, Dennis
Ritchie, or Chuq von Rospach or whatever the f__k his name
is.

I don't have any unix-haters archives handy. Some people
have sent me mail telling me they have pieces. If you have
anything resembling a complete archive, or even a "best-of"
collection, send mail to ugh. We will use these as a
starting point for the main text, and sprinkle a few choice
rants, verbatim, as inserts to spice up the text.

I will approach the publication of this book in a serious,
profit-minded way. It is not GnuEmacs, ok? When done, all
contributers will receive a complete online source for their
own pleasure. But let's get one thing straight, if copies of
the manuscript get posted to alt.books, I can guarantee
exactly four books will actually get sold in a real store.

The other thing to get straight is that nobody but Steven King
and Gary Larson gets rich from writing a book, so don't start arguing
over how to split those multimillion-dollar royalty checks. If we're 
LUCKY, we'll have enough to buy an order of ravs for everyone when 
Mary's opens again, OK? If you have published a book of your own,
you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, you're in for an

There is no difference between "the fundamental design flaws

If you had to write umpteen versions of of a pathname parser

make a number of "incidental implementation bugs."  And it
wouldn't be your fault.  It just not reasonable to expect
that every programmer that comes along has the

	- abstract to an article in the Jan 1992 issue of the Journal of
	  Object-Oriented programming

The fundamental design flaw in Unix is the asinine belief
that "programs are written to be executed by computers
rather than read by humans."  [Now that statement may be
true in the statistical sense in that it applies to most
programs.  But it is totally, absolutely wrong in the moral
sense.]

That's why we have C -- a language designed to make every
machine emulate a PDP-11.  That's why we have a file system
that forces every file to be viewed as a sequence of bytes
(after all, that's what they are, right?).  That's why
"protocols" depend on byte-order.

They have never separated the program from the machine.  It
never entered their tiny, pocket-protectored with a
calculator-hanging-from-the-belt mind.


Another thought: Unix is a lot like the US economy -- it
focuses on the short term, easy to quantify, small scale
detail, while ignoring long term results and screwing the
average joe.  Yes, the entire economy is built around the
idea of cheap energy.  Yes, cheap energy is killing the
planet.  Yes, we have to send our young off to foreign lands
to die to maintain our supply.  But no, we can't fix it, too
much depends on it.  Think of the chaos; think of the loss
of productivity; think of the loss of profits for the elite.

I'm sure, if you looked into it closely enough, you'd find
that Bill Joy and AT&T were involved with the Kennedy
assassination.


I ranting now.  See what your calm rational suggestion did
to me?  Maybe I'll go have a cup of coffee, reboot this
machine, and take a deep breath.  That should take a
while...

    The following opinion will probably get me kicked off this
    mailing list, but what the hell.

Kick me off too.  I have thought about suggesting this for a
long time.  It would be great to see Unix get what it
deserves or to have a list ready to give to some manager
type showing why it is a bad choice.  Have a list in print
might change many persons minds and help everyone in the
long run.

    I see nothing wrong with flaming about Unix lossage; if
    anything, this mailing list acts as a support group for
    those who are forced to live with Unix.  But once in a
    while, why not actually do something *constructive*
    rather than just complaining to the converted?  In
    particular, I'd love to see a serious critique of Unix
    in the form of a conference paper or journal paper with
    a title like "Remaining Trouble Spots in Unix" or "Unix
    Considered Harmful".  The purpose of such an article
    would be to explain to the rest of the world, in a very
    professional fashion, why Unix inspires such unbridled
    negative reactions in the members of this mailing list.
    In particular, I would like to see such an article
    separate, as much as possible, the fundamental design
    flaws of Unix from the more incidental implementation
    bugs.

With all the talented computer types on this list we should
be able to create a significant document which could alter
computing history.  Lets do more than just ridicule Unix,
lets kill it!  Wouldn't it be great to see this mailing list
disappear someday?


    Would anyone be interested in writing such an article?

for format differ from Silens's.  It cannot be amateurishly

I can't help but to juxtapose Stan's quote with my favorite
quote from computer science (from Abelson and Sussman's
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"):

   ... we want to establish the idea that a computer
   language is not just a way of getting a computer to
   perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal
   medium for expressing ideas about methodology.  Thus,
   programs must be written for people to read, and only
   incidentally for machines to execute.

At least *somebody* has the priorities straight!

No. Wrong. Get with the program. The world -is-

Personally, I take a somewhat less strident position on
smileys.  I merely prefer that, if they are used, they at
least be moderately original.  Can't you just picture
Candide or Jurgen sprinkled with this little guy?  ~/:^)
Why, the very cultural guerrila-hood of it would mildly (OK,
OK, *very* mildly) warm the heart, even though *this* one
:-) is pretty damn tired, and should no doubt be retired.

What *I* hate are .sig blocks.  All of 'em.  Especially when
I'm on a serial link (like right now).  Sometimes (usually),
you have to sit through a screenful of mailer header crud, a
copied, indented version of something you've already seen
copied and indented a half dozen times already, followed by
the person's little, marginally worthwhile comment
(generally identical to everyone else's), and then another
screenful containing *two* copies of some inane, ornate .sig
semi-iconically depicting the dude/ette's entire record
collection, philosophy of life, the configuration of their
Amiga, every conceivable net address that could possibly
bounce mail directed to them, their political affiliations,
the complete details of their sex life and income tax
returns for the past decade, the dollar sum of all the
military contracts they have directed towards basic research
on artificially intelligent paramecia, the definitive
answers to why choosy mothers choose Jif and why the chicken
crossed the road, not to mention what it did once it got to
the other side, and the abstract of their scholarly
dissertation on the "Ontology and Oncology of Chicken
Road-Crossings, Droppings, and the Post-Darwinian
Industrio-Dental Ethos" ...

If you could always just see the person's little comment
without the "benefit" of all the wrapping, it would probably
raise the GNP by some tiny fraction of a percentage point.
I propose we trade .sigs for smileys on a one-for-one basis,
thereby raising the GNP by some vanishingly small fraction

Re: Solaris, finally an appropriate name.

Not being a reader of arcane science fiction, I wasn't able
to find a copy of Lem's novel.  But as an occasional student
of literary criticism, I did have a access to a copy of
"Alien Encounters: anatomy of Science Fiction" by Mark Rose
(Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1981), which
includes a reasonably extensive discussion of Stanislaw
Lem's novel "Solaris" in ch.3, pp. 82-95.

I quote from Rose's comments, which you might also find
enlightening:

"Lem's initial move in Solaris is to choose as problematic a
sign of the nonhuman as possible. ...

"By making Solaris itself as unyieldingly problematic as
possible, Lem shifts the narrative emphasis ...

"Has the ocean [of Solaris] failed to respond to human
overtures because it is serenely contemptuous of mankind?
...

"as the novel proceeds, the inquiry turns more and more
emphatically into an analysis of the human motives behind
the whole Solarist enterprise ...

"And late in the novel we hear about the scholar Muntius,
who regards the Solarist enterprise as 'the space era's
equivalent of religion: faith disguised as science.' ...

"According to Muntius, 'Solaristics is a revival of
long-vanished myths, the expression of mystical nostalgias
which men are unwilling to confess openly.' ...

"Lem attempts to keep [Solaris] his sign of the nonhuman as
empty, as nonreferential as possible ...

"In Solaris, however, where there is little sense of joy,
the complex of protective barriers and enclosures seem
rather to be an expression of agoraphobia, the fear of open
places ..."

Of course these comments refer solely to Lem's work of
fiction, not, it must be understood, to anything else that
might by pure coincidence have the same name.

Subject: Source Control In Hell

It really pisses me off that the Source Code Control System
didn't use the normal, industry-standard "From
"-at-the-beginning-of-a-line delimiter, but instead had to
implement a proprietary protocol.  Not only that, but it
uses upper-case letters -- must be a VMS holdover!  Haven't
they heard of Open Sources(tm)?

I think this is a small gem of Unix Philosophy In Action:
A source-control system which
* embeds information in text files (Hey, it's all 8-bit
  bytes!)
* which doesn't quote its meta-information, making it
  indistinguishable from the user's intended code
* chooses a sequence of characters which probably worked on
  the first ten files they tried it on, even though one
  minute's thought would reveal that buckets of C code
  contains printf statements, some of which might very well
  contain %X%X sequences.
  [For true brain-curdling unix horror, consider that the
  authors might have realised that "%X%" might occur in
  user code, but then brilliantly determined that for C
  printf-like functions, "%X%" is equivalent to "%0X%" and
  hence no change -to SCCS- would be necessary for that
  class of lossage.  And nobody would want to use the "%"
  character other than in C printf, would they?]
* requires users to alter their data in order to compensate
  for system implementation bugs

* undoubtedly (ok, I haven't verified this, but can you
  imagine it working?) fails on lines longer than 255
  characters, on lines containing ASCII 0 characters, and
  probably on all files which contain binary junk (hey,
  it's all 8-bit bytes!) in the form ASCII "control" or
  bit-7-set characters,

I've no idea what a "portable C programmer" might be.  My

WANT TO BE*.

- The Fortran compiler I use is f2c (the vendor's compiler

- I am seriously considering changing from the vendor's

  propagation code firmly believes that procedure passed as
  parameters to other procedures are never called, so that
  variables they set -- and *exist* to set -- are
  unaffected); I may even do my own p2c

- The Scheme systems I use are built on top of C.
- Want to guess what the Prolog systems I use are built on?

Why am I retraining myself in Ada?  Because since 1979 I
have been trying to write reliable code in C.  (Definition:
reliable code never gives wrong answers without an explicit
apology.)  Trying and failing.  I have been frustrated to
the screaming point by trying to write code that could
survive (some) run-time errors in other people's code linked
with it.  I'd look wistfully at BSD's three-argument signal
handlers, which at least offered the possibility of provide
hardware specific recovery code in #ifdefs, but grit my
teeth and struggle on having to write code that would work
in System V as well.

There are times when I feel that clocks are running faster
but the calendar is running backwards.  My first serious
programming was done in Burroughs B6700 Extended Algol.  I
got used to the idea that if the hardware can't give you the
right answer, it complains, and your ON OVERFLOW statement
has a chance to do something else.  That saved my bacon more
than once.

When I met C, it was obviously pathetic compared with the
_real_ languages I'd used, but heck, it ran on a 16-bit
machine, and it was better than 'as'.  When the VAX came
out, I was very pleased: "the interrupt on integer overflow
bit is _just_ what I want".  Then I was very disappointed:
"the wretched C system _has_ a signal for integer overflow
but makes sure it never happens even when it ought to".

It would be a good thing if hardware designers would
remember that the ANSI C standard provides _two_ forms of
"integer" arithmetic: 'unsigned' arithmetic which must wrap
around, and 'signed' arithmetic which MAY TRAP (or wrap, or
make demons fly out of your nose).  "Portable C
programmers", know that they CANNOT rely on integer
arithmetic _not_ trapping, and they know (if they have done
their homework) that there are commercially significant
machines where C integer overflow _is_ trapped, so they
would rather the Alpha trapped so that they could use the
Alpha as a porting base.

Having said which: I will gladly put up with the Alpha
exception mechanism as long as
    - there is a documented C-callable function which
      controls the integer trapping state
    - there is a documented C-callable function which
      controls IEEE-ish floating-point traps 
    - there is a documented C-callable function which
      includes a barrier (can I _rely_ on signal(SIGFPE, f)
      including a barrier?)

No, don't ask me why we need to even KEEP a 64MB syslog
file.  I could just blow it away, but knowing unix that
might completely fill up the rest of my disk!

But wait, there's more!

Of course, since we don't have a REAL NETWORK with CLIENTS
and SERVERS I can't put it on a backup tape unless I move it
to Brigade first.  So I can't even trust moving it to
Brigade, because the checksum program (sum) gives two
different answers on the two machines.  Of course, I could
use ASS-BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY MODE on a test binary file,
because I sure as HELL don't trust ftp:

pseudo@brigade> sum -r foo
sum: Can't open -r
37798   160 foo

pseudo@regiment> sum -r foo
37798   320 foo

How's that for super compatibility? I guess you're supposed
to think that 160 = 320 in compatibility mode. You see, it
IS compatible, as long as you don't depend on getting a
consistent value for the file size. But you know, just
because a meaningless attribute like "block count" changes
unpredictably when you move a file from disk to disk doesn't
mean you can ignore it.  Check out this twisted gem from
sum's man page:

  DIAGNOSTICS
    Read error is indistinguishable from end-of-file on most
    devices; check the block count.

No, no, Steve, you don't understand.  Your version of the
"compress" program is the first of a new generation of unix
utilities that make use of the Dynamic Expunge Feature.
Remember all those people flaming about how UNIX lacks the
separate DELETE, UNDELETE, and EXPUNGE commands we used to
have on primitive operating systems?  Well, the UNIX
maintainers Heard our Prayers.

Your "compress" program cleverly spawns a child before
exiting, and leaves the child with an open file descriptor
on your deleted file.  Thus, the file itself lingers on,
without cluttering up your directory listings, until the
system is next rebooted or the process is killed.  Should
you need to UNDELETE, simply run the "dd" program with
appropriate arguments to copy your file from the raw disk
device; the slight additional overhead of the copy operation
is more than paid for by the defragmenting effect it will
have on your file.

Please note that the Dynamic Expunge Feature does not
require any kernel modifications or new system programs.
Another triumph for the "lots of tiny tools" school of
operating system design!

Apparently the point of my message was lost on some.

It's of no conceivable interest to me what shell someone is
running.  Or, more accurately, what shell they are given by
default.  The only reason I get told that is because it's in
the passwd file, and finger is so stupid all it knows to do
is look there, and some boucephalic idiot figured it might
as well tell me since it's there along with the user's full
name.  Actually I'm surprised it doesn't tell me the
person's encrypted password too.

But I might want to know any of the several useful things
the ITS finger give me that unix finger doesn't.  Like what
the person does, who they work for, what job they are
currently running, when they last logged out if they aren't
running a job, and what actual terminal they are logged in
from.

ITS is the *only* operating system I know of that got that
last right.  The supdup protocol (at least; I don't know
about telnet) allows the client computer to pass a location
string along to the host for this purpose, so that you can
be logged in through arbitrarily many supdup links and your
console location is transitively displayed by finger at the
far end.  Apparently it was ``impossible'' to make this work
under 20X, despite serious efforts by several very smart
hackers, apparently because there was no place the
information could be passed between the supdup acceptor
process and the HACTRN-equivalent (what did 20 call that?
God it's been a long time) it created.

Unix, of course, doesn't even try.

No, actually, that's not true.  I'm told that there's a
helpful field in the passwd file you can set, and *that*
will be displayed as your terminal location.  Even if you
are logged in from a STY.  In Mallorca.

I don't understand.  Why would you want your shell to be a
debugger?  Was it because ITS had so little disk space that
you had to do limit coredumpsize 0?  ;-)

/bin/sh is one of the most important features of Unix.
Treating all data as strings and files makes life so much
easier for writing the shell scripts, I don't see how you
could do it in a debugger, even one more powerful (?!?!?)
than GDB.

Ah yes.  The extended info that ITS finger/etc kept about
each user (and allowed them to update, of course) was quite
nice.  X.400 does all that for one now, of course, using
only a couple hundred times the CPU cycles and memory
storage...

Actually, at IncPresU there was a "terminal location"
database that kept track of where which terminal server
ports were, so that when you connected from one of the
"ethertips" (using PUP or TCP), finger would print the
correct location.  This went away when you connected via
multiple hops, though.  The "telnet location" option was
eventually defined, but hardly anyone implements it.  I
think that on "dialin" lines, the user could even modify
their own location...

The "EXEC".  The problem with tops20 was there wasn't any
particularly good way for one process to glean info from
another.

    Unix, of course, doesn't even try.

And the problem is much worse, since of course the process
that talks to the tcp connection (telnetd) is not the same
process that the user is talking to (the infamous shell),
and even THEY can't talk to each other in any useful manner.
Blech.  It's all a matter of not being very sensible about
who needs what info, and of course, one must be sure not to
pollute the idea that nothing more complex than a single
byte stream is ever needed to talk between two processes.

It's an UNIX kernel's message meaning you have too many UNIX
processes to fork a new process.

I believe you can kill some less important processes as a
super user.  (Some proc table elements are reserved for
super user.) But at first, use "ps -aux" command to
investigate why you have so many processes.  (SUN's GENERIC
kernel allows 128 processes, kernels used here allows 512.)

If all processes on your computer seem normal and you often
have this message, you need to reconfigure your kernel to
increace the limit of processes. To do this, edit
configuration file and increse "maxuser" entry. (The max
umber of processes is defined as "10 + 16 * MAXUSERS", and
MAXUSERS is 8 for SUN GENERIC, 32 for kernels used here.)

Subject: Service Order # 977764...Trouble With Cron After Time Change
From: SunGuy
To: ...


The problem you have run into is a known problem and has not
yet been fixed (I guess that last part is rather obvious
:-)).

Three ways to fix the problem:

1) reboot the system
2) do the command "crontab -e" as a user,
	specifically write the editor file (without making
	any changes) and then quit (e.g. if the editor that
	comes up is vi(1), then type ":wq<ret>").  This will
	signal the cron daemon to reread all the crontab files
	and will get it out of the wedged state it is in.
3) restart the cron daemon by doing the following:

	ps -aux | grep cron | grep -v grep
	kill -9 <pid for cron daemon>
	rm /var/spool/cron/FIFO
	type "cron<ret>"

	e.g.:

	rumrunner# ps -aux | grep cron | grep -v grep
	root       160  0.0  0.6  444  184 ?  S    Mar 26  2:50 cron
	rumrunner# kill -9 160
	rumrunner# rm /var/spool/cron/FIFO
	rumrunner# cron
	rumrunner# 


The attempt was made to correct the problem a while ago, but
it resulted in cron running jobs twice, so the fix was
removed from the code.

To keep the problem from re-occuring in the future, do not
schedule cron jobs to run between 1:59 am and 3:01 am (for
the night that the time change occures).

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Intent

   This memo describes the Finger user information protocol.  This is a
   simple protocol which provides an interface to a remote user
   information program (RUIP).

   Based on RFC 742, a description of the original Finger protocol, this
   memo attempts to clarify the expected communication between the two
   ends of a Finger connection.  It also tries not to invalidate the
   many current implementations or add unnecessary restrictions to the
   original protocol definition.

   The most prevalent implementations of Finger today seem to be
   primarily derived from the BSD UNIX work at the University of
   California, Berkeley.  Thus, this memo is based around the BSD
   version's behavior.

   However, the BSD version provides few options to tailor the Finger
   RUIP for a particular site's security policy, or to protect the user
   from dangerous data.  Furthermore, there are MANY potential security
   holes that implementors and administrators need to be aware of,
   particularly since the purpose of this protocol is to return
   information about a system's users, a sensitive issue at best.
   Therefore, this memo makes a number of important security comments
   and recommendations.

[...]

3.  Security

3.1.  Implementation security

   Sound implementation of Finger is of the utmost importance.
   Implementations should be tested against various forms of attack.  In
   particular, an RUIP SHOULD protect itself against malformed inputs.
   Vendors providing Finger with the operating system or network
   software should subject their implementations to penetration testing.

   Finger is one of the avenues for direct penetration, as the Morris
   worm pointed out quite vividly.  Like Telnet, FTP and SMTP, Finger is
   one of the protocols at the security perimeter of a host.
   Accordingly, the soundness of the implementation is paramount.  The
   implementation should receive just as much security scrutiny during
   design, implementation, and testing as Telnet, FTP, or SMTP.


3.2.  RUIP security

   Warning!!  Finger discloses information about users; moreover, such
   information may be considered sensitive.  Security administrators
   should make explicit decisions about whether to run Finger and what
   information should be provided in responses.  One existing
   implementation provides the time the user last logged in, the time he
   last read mail, whether unread mail was waiting for him, and who the
   most recent unread mail was from!  This makes it possible to track
   conversations in progress and see where someone's attention was
   focused.  Sites that are information-security conscious should not
   run Finger without an explicit understanding of how much information
   it is giving away.

3.2.1.  {Q2} refusal

   For individual site security concerns, the system administrator
   SHOULD be given an option to individually turn on or off RUIP
   processing of {Q2}.  If RUIP processing of {Q2} is turned off, the
   RUIP MUST return a service refusal message of some sort.  "Finger
   forwarding service denied" is adequate.  The purpose of this is to
   allow individual hosts to choose to not forward Finger requests, but
   if they do choose to, to do so consistently.

   Overall, there are few cases which would warrant processing of {Q2}
   at all, and they are far outweighed by the number of cases for
   refusing to process {Q2}.  In particular, be aware that if a machine
   is part of security perimeter (that is, it is a gateway from the
   outside world to some set of interior machines), then turning {Q2} on
   provides a path through that security perimeter.  Therefore, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the default of the {Q2} processing option be to
   refuse processing.  It certainly should not be enabled in gateway
   machines without careful consideration of the security implications.

3.2.2.  {C} refusal

   For individual site security concerns, the system administrator
   SHOULD be given an option to individually turn on or off RUIP
   acceptance of {C}.  If RUIP processing of {C} is turned off, the RUIP
   MUST return a service refusal message of some sort.  "Finger online
   user list denied" is adequate.  The purpose of this is to allow
   individual hosts to choose to not list the users currently online.

3.2.3.  Atomic discharge

   All implementations of Finger SHOULD allow individual system
   administrators to tailor what atoms of information are returned to a
   query.  For example:

      -    Administrator A should be allowed to specifically choose to
           return office location, office phone number, home phone
           number, and logged in/logout time.

      -    Administrator B should be allowed to specifically choose to
           return only office location, and office phone number.

      -    Administrator C should be allowed to specifically choose to
           return the minimum amount of required information, which is
           the person's full name.

3.2.4.  User information files

   Allowing an RUIP to return information out of a user-modifiable file
   should be seen as equivalent to allowing any information about your
   system to be freely distributed.  That is, it is potentially the same
   as turning on all specifiable options.  This information security
   breach can be done in a number of ways, some cleverly, others
   straightforwardly.  This should disturb the sleep of system
   administrators who wish to control the returned information.

3.2.5.  Execution of user programs

   Allowing an RUIP to run a user program in response to a Finger query
   is potentially dangerous.  BE CAREFUL!! -- the RUIP MUST NOT allow
   system security to be compromised by that program.  Implementing this
   feature may be more trouble than it is worth, since there are always
   bugs in operating systems, which could be exploited via this type of
   mechanism.

3.2.6.  {U} ambiguity

   Be aware that a malicious user's clever and/or persistent use of this
   feature can result in a list of most of the usernames on a system.
   Refusal of {U} ambiguity should be considered in the same vein as
   refusal of {C} requests (see section 3.2.2).

3.2.7.  Audit trails

   Implementations SHOULD allow system administrators to log Finger
   queries.

3.3.  Client security

   It is expected that there will normally be some client program that
   the user runs to query the initial RUIP.  By default, this program
   SHOULD filter any unprintable data, leaving only printable 7-bit
   characters (ASCII 32 through ASCII 126), tabs (ASCII 9), and CRLFs.

   This is to protect against people playing with terminal escape codes,
   changing other peoples' X window names, or committing other dastardly
   or confusing deeds.  Two separate user options SHOULD be considered
   to modify this behavior, so that users may choose to view
   international or control characters:

      -    one to allow all characters less than ASCII 32

      -    another to allow all characters greater than ASCII 126

   For environments that live and breathe international data, the system
   administrator SHOULD be given a mechanism to enable the latter option
   by default for all users on a particular system.  This can be done
   via a global environment variable or similar mechanism.

I would not be startled in the least tiny bit.  Nor would I
think that 'ls' ought to be solid.  I have seen several
discussions, one I think on alt.sys.sun where a user was
complaining about a specific behavior and wondering if it
was a bug, and blaming the software &| hardware provider.
The poster was told that this behavior was known, and was a
bug, but not to blame Sun since the code came from BSD and
that came from AT&T (the bourne shell I believe).

The replier then went on to enumerate several other bugs
that everyone seemed to know about and that had been
plaguing people for years, and yet nobody had fixed them.
Nearly every company that came out with a machine running
unix, ported the code, bugs and all, and presumably did not
fix the bugs because of the fear of being struck by a
lightning bolt from the unix gods.  Or possibly if they
fixed the bugs it would not be "compatible".  This kind of
thing has been happening for years, and it is instead
amazing to see that there manages to be any progress at all.

One company has been fixing the bugs. The problem is, they
get panned for it.

The problem is that if you fix the bugs you need to KEEP
fixing them in every release because AT&T (or USL) never
bothers to fold any fixes back into the source release. So
either you give up fixing them or you give up picking up
every new release of UNIX.

Can you figure out which company I'm talking about now?

1. A distributed operating system should look, to the
customer, just like a non-distributed operating system,
apart from the possibility of more creative failure modes.
Cleverness should go into hiding its distributed nature, not
exposing it.

2. Unix filesystem semantics -- resources organized in a
tree structure named by ASCII names, and operated on by
open/close/read/write -- work just as well in a distributed
system as in a non-distributed one, unlike most of their
competitors.

3. Most resources are used by only one customer at a time,
so it is important to streamline the *un*shared case while
handling the shared case gracefully.

4. Pipes are an excellent interprocess-communication method,
superior to most of their competitors in flexibility and
distributability (is that a word? :-))... provided you have
some way of establishing them between unrelated processes,
and preferably some way of passing them between processes
dynamically.

5. Most distributed-OS designers would rather design
something new and weird, in hopes that everyone will say
"oh, how wonderful, we must rewrite all our programs to use
this at once", than observe point #1 above and build a
distributed implementation of the same old thing, on which
all that software will run without change.

the shell window would vanish but the emacs would remain,
although it would look as if I was gone, thanks to yet
another lovely X feature.

I went to the console.  It seemed to know that it was halted
although there was no explanation as to why.  A phone call
revealed that it was shut down in order to install new
authorization codes, because the old ones were going to
expire.  You have to reboot to do that?  Of course.

In fact, a system shutdown message had gone to all shell
windows!  The display I'm on, being polite and
well-mannered, never beeps.

Apparently there is some tiny tool called "Zephyr" which
might have notified me of the impending shutdown, although

Gosh, maybe I could put a system-going-down handler in my

    ... Hmmm, I wonder....  Do these 'resellers', when they
    detect and/or fix a bug, bother to report said bug to
    *their* supplier, so that the _originator_ of said bug
    can fix it?  Any re-sellers wish to comment on this?

I formerly worked at <somecompany>, working on a BSD based
UNIX system which was one of the first outside-of-SUN ports
of NFS, and later at <someothercompany> on SVr4.

I can assure you that we *did* detect/fix bugs, and report
them to our suppliers:

    BSD
    AT&T
    SUN

Berkeley was the only group that was at all willing to
accept fixes from outside.

Both AT&T and SUN had a great big "Not Invented Here"
attitude - they would refuse to accept fixes, or fixes would
go into a big black hole, or the next release would have
"fixed" the bug you reported, but with code different from
what you reported - and their fix wouldn't be correct, or...

Hell... one fellow added comments to a rather abstruse code
section, and they were not allowed to be added to the next
official release.

Subject: Translation


Often, when using the Unix(TM) computer system, one will
find that the error messages one receives are terse and do
not convey the problem precisely. In these cases, a
translation function is useful.

For example, I recently received the following helpful error
message from the C compiler of my DECstation 5000/200, a
state-of-the-art Unix(TM) workstation:

jw>  make CC=cc CFLAGS='-Dvolatile=""'
  cc -Dvolatile="" -c machinestate.S
  input buffer on non-int boundry	<===

A brief study of the situation reveals that the full and
correct English translation of this error message is:

  The C compiler has just deleted your source file
  "machinestate.S" without a trace.  It has also deleted
  the old version of the object file, in case you were
  thinking of recreating the source by disassembling the
  object. The compiler notices with regret that the source
  file in question contained a hairy interrupt-driven
  multithreaded scheduling kernel which you have just
  gotten to work right after N days of effort, and
  respectfully suggests that you may wish to consider
  killing yourself at this time.

Oh well, see you later. Time to run down to Dorchester and

In attempting to translate a Unix error message into

is.  Absorb it on that basis.  Go with the flow.

More to the point, you have all the sources on line, don't
you?  (No Unix system is complete without them.)  Simply
grep for the error message.  The meaning is the message; the
code is the secret.  The experience user will know what
needs to be done.

A truely elegant Unix would eschew the use of English-like

If your error message had been just, say, "+2C)", you would
have been equally enlightened, and could have grep'ed just
as easily - but much more quickly.

Subject: Flame


I just sent the following flame to (oh no!) Unix newsgroup
comp.arch.  Since most of you probably don't put up with
such lossage (I know I'm weak), I thought you might like to
see it.

In some article PS writes:

*   In another article DB writes:
*   > Unix programmers have a bizzare idea of
*   > efficiency. Emacs misuses pointers to save a few bytes
*   > (while being huge and bloated), XWindows is a pig, but
*   > hey, we saved a JMP! :-)

*   That's not UNIX, that's MITnix. This massive abuse of
*   virtual memory seems to have come in with the MIT "free"
*   software: X, the GNU stuff, and so on...  --

First of all, memory for PCs (and soon for workstations)
runs for about $30/MB, and 8 additional MB take care of both
X and GNU Emacs.

In addition, I won't say much about X, which I dislike,
although if I'm not mistaken most of the bloat has occurred
because of vendor requests.  X 10 was much leaner, and
provided more than sufficient functionality as far as I'm
concerned.

With respect to Emacs, may I remind you that the original
version ran on ITS on a PDP-10, whose address space was 1
moby, i.e. 256 thousand 36-bit words (that's a little over 1
Mbyte).  It had plenty of space to contain many large files,
and the actual program was a not-too-large fraction of that
space.

There are many reasons why GNU Emacs is as big as it is
while its original ITS counterpart was much smaller:

- C is a horrible language in which to implement such things
as a Lisp interpreter and an interactive program.  In
particular any program that wants to be careful not to crash
(and dump core) in the presence of errors has to become
bloated because it has to check everywhere.  A reasonable
condition system would reduce the size of the code.

- Unix is a horrible operating system for which to write an
Emacs-like editor because it does not provide adequate
support for anything except trivial "Hello world" programs.
In particular, there is no standard good way (or even any in
many variants) to control your virtual memory sharing
properties.

- Unix presents such a poor interaction environment to users
(the various shells are pitiful) that GNU Emacs has had to
import a lot of the functionality that a minimally adequate
"shell" would provide.  Many programmers at TLA never
directly interact with the shell, GNU Emacs IS their shell,
because it is the only adequate choice, and isolates them
from the various Unix (and even OS) variants.

Don't complain about TLA programs vs. Unix.  The typical
workstation Unix requires 3 - 6 Mb just for the kernel, and
provides less functionality (at the OS level) than the OSs
of yesteryear.  It is not surprising that programs that ran
on adequate amounts of memory under those OSs have to
reimplement some of the functionality that Unix has never
provided.

What is Unix doing with all that memory?  No, don't answer,
I know, it is all those pre-allocated fixed-sized tables and
buffers in the kernel that I'm hardly ever using on my
workstation but must have allocated at ALL times for the
rare times when I actually need them.  Any non-brain-damaged
OS would have a powerful internal memory manager, but who
ever said that Unix was an OS?

What is Unix doing with all that file space?  No don't
answer.  It is providing all sorts of accounting junk which
is excesive for personal machines, and inadequate for large
systems.  After all, any important file in the system has
been written by root -- terribly informative.  And all that
wonderfully descriptive information after lots of memory
consumed by accounting daemons and megabytes of disk taken
up by the various useless log files.

Just so you won't say that it is only TLA OSs and software
that has such problems, consider everyone's favorite text
formatter, TeX (I'm being sarchastic, although when compared
with troff and relatives...).  The original version ran
under FLA on PDP-10s.  It is also bloated under Unix, and it
also must go through contortions in order to dump a
pre-loaded version of itself, among other things.

Subject: Caution:  No User Configurable Parts Inside....



	Yesterday afternoon, I undertook the "simple" task
of moving machine W from subnet A to subnet B...which would
seem to be an easy task...

	Remembering that there is little one can do to a
modern sun unix box when it hasn't properly booted and found
it's file servers, etc., I took care to change "all" the
magic files on the machine before shutting it down for the
move -- changing internet address both on the machine and on
the master YP server.  Since I thought I would move the
machine back later, I dutifly kept around the old versions
of relevant files with a suitable extension.

	I moved the machine to the other side of the floor,
plugged it in, and it failed to boot.  Well, at this point I
needed to muck around with the configuration to find out
why...but, since the machines files cannot be edited in this
preboot state, I had little choice but to netboot the
machine (yes, one can use the CD-ROM to boot it, but this is
just as painful, I've been through that, too).  Now, I
couldn't netboot off of subnet B which I'd moved to since it
didn't have a machine on the network setup to allow
netbooting (and I'm sure that setting this up is just about
as intuitive as everything else...).  So, that meant I had
to physically cart the machine back across the floor to the
old connection on subnet A.

	Back on subnet A, I find that some boot file not
only looks for magicfilename, it looks through
magicfilename.*....then expects * to match to something of
the form xx0.  So, when I kept around a backup with my own
extension, this violated the assumptions of the fragile
script and it bombed out in some way.  I didn't bother
trying to figure out the full implications here since I
don't understand sh subtleties and would prefer not to.  I
deleted my nice old files (I wasn't going to 2nd-guess it
and try to come up with a name it wouldn't decide to
misinterpret), and move the machine back across the floor
(even IPCs aren't exactly portable machines).

	Now it stopped complaining about that, but was
unable to find the machine where most of the rest of its
file were stored.  It turns out said machine had been on the
same subnet prior to the move, but was on a different subnet
afterwards.  I suppose, I should have guessed that this
would break every assumption in the boot script.

	Just as I was about to string a cable and give up on
any sort of software solution to this problem, I ran into a
unix-wizard.  I described my problem and he said, "Ah! Your
machine needs to know the gateway for getting off of your
network."  So, we looked at the arcane boot scripts and
found that there was an obscure comment in one of them which
implied we needed to put the hostname of the gateway in a
magic file, then copy over the "route" program to the root
partion.  Then the script would go off and install some
fixed route through the gateway and all would be happy. I
was concerned that this might not work because of Sun's
great innovation known as dynamic libraries (in a previous
fight with booting a machine, I'd tried copying files to the
root partition and found that it didn't work when all the
dynamic libraries weren't mounted....and I had no clue what
all it wanted).  The wizard insisted that sun must not be
that brain dead so things should be fine.

	I moved the machine back to subnet A, edited the
magic file, and copied over the route program.  Back on
subnet B the machine failed to boot for two reasons: (1) it
couldn't find cat (2) it couldn't find ld.so (the shared
libraries).  So the script had lied, it really needed cat,
as well (which also uses dynamic libraries)...AND the route
was also dynamically linked.

	Back on subnet A, we found that in other places in
the same shell-script, Sun had used shcat (something they
defined in the script) since cat wasn't around -- clearly we
were dealing with a piece of code that had never been used
before.  Consulation with another unix-wizard led us to find
a staticly linked version of route on some other machine
around the lab.  By now the unix-braindeath was so
prevelant, I gave up and hard-coded the ip address for the
gateway machine into the shell script and carted the machine
back to subnet B -- where it again failed to come up.

	Now the first wizard comes in and plays around with
ifconfig and decides that the netmask is set wrong.  Further
perusal of the boot files convinces him that if I add an
entry to another magic file, it will override the default
(and wrong) assumptions made by ifconfig about what part of
the ip address consitutes our physical network.  Another
round trip later, the machine gets a step further and tells
me that I don't have access to mount the filesystem I want.
This turns out to be due to the fact that it had been 8
hours since I started this project and I'd never gotten
around to updating the real canonical source in our
namespace and the automagic update and finally kicked in and
trashed my name change -- that, at least, was easy to fix.

	...so, 8 to 9 hours later, the machine now runs on
subnet B.  I think next time I'll just run a long cable and
yell back real loud at anyone who complains about the mess
of cables around the lab....

Subject: AFS tokens expiring


This morning from about 11:30 am to 1:00 pm users who
attempted to access afs files located on <host> would get
back an error saying that their token had expired. This
anomaly was caused by the fact that <host>'s clock was an
hour behind, so newly aquired tokens presented to its
fileserver appeared to have a start time in the future and
thus were rejected. The problem was fixed by manually
resetting the time

The clock got so far behind due to the following series of
events:

A process on <host> was writing a file into AFS which was
larger than the AFS cache on that machine. This caused the
in-kernel AFS cache manager to continiously print the
message :

   " <host> vmunix: afs: cache too small: flushing active file"

Since this message was being written to a 300 baud hardcopy
console at a high interupt level, it was causing significant
delays to the rest of the system.  One of the results of
these delays was that clock interupts were lost, and another
was that 'ntpd' was not given a chance to run and fix the
time skew. By the time the process acausing the problem
finished the time skew was too large for ntpd to make
adjustments, thus manual intervention was required.

  Apparently-To: AB

(I wonder why this message can't have an ordinary "To:" field?)

  You were editing the file "/usr/man/cat1/more.1"
  at <Wed Apr 22 14:35> on the machine ``janus''
  when the system went down.

I was?  This is certainly news to me.  Of course we're
talking over two weeks ago here, so I may have mercifully
forgotten whatever incident precipitated this.  I've never
heard of the file in question, but perhaps this has
something to do with the inner workings of the `man' command
or the emacs command M-x manual-entry...

  You can retrieve most of your changes to this file
  using the "recover" command of the editor.

Ho ho.  "The Editor" huh?  I wonder which one?

  An easy way to do this is to give the command "vi -r /usr/man/cat1/more.1".
  This method also works using "ex" and "edit".

Ohhh that editor....  OK, just for giggles, I tried starting
up vi with this command.  The first thing I learned is that
vi doesn't know about the TERMCAP environment variable --
quite a surprise to me, given the repeated claims that the
whole system of termcap kludges exists solely to support
vi...  But I digress.  The second thing I learned is:

  "/usr/man/cat1/more.1" File not found

Oh well, I guess I should have simply ignored it...

    Date: Tue, 19 May 1992 16:14 EDT

    My copy ended the same way, so it's probably ok.
    I was hoping to tweak G. into using a signature, but
    he's pretty set in his ways.



[Flame on!  WHOOOSH!]

I'm afraid I am quite of a mind with G., being a firm
adherent of the "Klingon" school of email, whose dictum is,
"Don't greet, don't sign, just say what you have to say in
the nearest approximation to English you can manage.".


If you use signatures as a way to reassure yourself that you
got the whole message, think again -- many people add cute
postscripts after their signatures.  Furthermore, in the
Un*x culture one finds extremely verbose signature blocks
that are inserted automatically by some brain-damaged piece
of mail software.  

These are the electronic equivalent of license plate frames
with cute slogans on them and should be banned.  At least
they should be banished to a header -- something like
"Cute-Signature: ..." which I could in extremis teach my
mail-reading program to hide from my sight.

SMTP, the protocol that mediates email on the Internet, is
guaranteed reliable end-to-end.  It is a well-defined
protocol, and it is the responsibility of every Internet
mail-reading program to implement it.  If characters are
being dropped, for whatever reason, it is a _bug_ and ought
to be fixed.  (I do not consider the local prevalence of
some idiotic text-formatter to be a valid excuse for
mangling my text.)  

However, the bug will almost certainly turn out to be in
Un*x, and therefore will be enshrined in such a way that
fixing it will require fixing other bugs in Un*x, and the
process never ends because there is no bug in Un*x so
egregious, so counterintuitive, so purely _wrong_ that some
pea-brained bozo's shell script doesn't depend on it doing
exactly what it now does.

The news that some dimwit's mail-reader handles specially lines that
.happen to begin with a period, because period in column 1 is the escape
..character for the Plugh-909 parser generator that no Un*x weenie can
...do without, will only encourage me to begin more lines with periods
....in the hopes of inconveniencing these scumsuckers enough to make
::..::>>them wake up and smell the coffee.

.So there.

Subject: Don't Grep Without /dev/null

Have you ever wondered why when you type m-x grep "-i cretin /vmunix"
Emacs actually runs the command "grep -n -i cretin /vmunix /dev/null"?

I'd always sort-of thought it was to avoid the screw case of
having the user ask to do "grep -i cretin" in which case the
pointy-headed program would assume that its input should
come from standard input and Emacs would wait indefinitely
for grep to do nothing.  (Of course, it should actually be a
wrong-number-of-arguments error, if I wanted input from
standard input I would have said "/dev/stdin", except of
course there is no way to name standard input in unix, even
though Everything Is A File.)

Well, it turns out that it does avoid this screw case
(coincidence or design -- you be the judge!), but, as one
would expect in the Wonderful World of Weenix, it has a
another side-effect.

"And that's not an unintended side-effect, that's a feature!"


I was trying to search a large number of files for a text
string.  Now, not having any sort of m-x List Callers
facility, I was reduced to text-search.  (Have you noticed
that ordinarily reasonably people these days seem to refer
to text-search as "grep"?  Perhaps this is much the as one
using the generic term "Kleenex" to refer to the things with
which one wipes up the parts of one's brain which have
dribbled out all over one's keyboard.)

First of all, I look briefly at the grep "man" page to
determine which combination of switches du jour I'll want.
Remember that man pages are praised by unix cretins for
their terseness and the simplicity with which one may
immediately reach the Important Information about what weird
goulash of switches a particular command requires.

I see that for my afternoon's scheduled grepping I do want
"-i" (real men are case-insensitive) and "-n" (precede each
line by its relative line number in the file."

I see that I definitely DON'T want "-h" ("Don't display
filenames.")  as I expect a large amount of output and DO
want to know in which particular file the string-matches
were found.

Now, because I was dealing with something larger than the
usual unix weenie 10-file system, I immediately exceeded the
shell's built-in command-line limit.

"No problem", say I, "instead of 

    grep -i -n version *.ps */*.ps */*/*.ps etc 

(ever notice how unix has no wild-inferiors directory
wildcard syntax?) I'll just run grep on each file, using
some magic bullshite incantation I'll steal from somebody
else who did this."

So I end up writing a shell script which does
 foreach f (`cd ../foolib; find . -name "*.ps" -print')
   grep -i -n version ../foolib/$f
 end
and so forth.

After exactly twelve attempts to get the above syntax
correct (and moving from to /bin/sh and back to /bin/csh in
the process as I could find marginally better documentation
on the weird iteration constructs of the latter) and lots of
cursing of content-free error-messages like "Badly placed
()'s", I finally get the script to run.

As output I get a zillion lines of the following type

  3:%%Version: 1.0
  182:    % generated this text.  Perhaps the version-stamp for the blorp code,
  3:%%Version: 1.0
  3:%%Version: 1.0
  239:  { .interpreter print ( v) print version =only
  45:% easier-to-debug versions of some procedures.
  87:{ % If we aren't in debugmode, here is a version of the above that does
  32:%          _version_               int             for future backward compat. - currently 0
  1215:    (, _version_ int NOT NULL\)) foocmd

and so forth, and so on, and so on.

Note that even though I know the exact line number in which
each "version" string was located, I have absolutely no
information about which files in the deep and broad
directory tree actually contain those line numbers.

Well, I fritter away some more idle minutes running another
ten or so iterations of running my shell script, adding and
removing switches, carefully checking that no commands are
aliased, that my search path is correct, that I'm actually
running grep on the correct files and that I am really
invoking grep without the "-h Do not display filenames"
switch.  I check the non-setting of "-h" many times, since
having it set would produce exactly the sort of lossage I
was experiencing.

Finally, about to tear my hair out, I happen to type "c-L"
in the Emacs buffer in which the grep options are displayed.
This recentres the window such that three additional lines
appear at the top of the buffer's window.  I read

----------------------------------------------------------------------
     want the filename to appear, use /dev/null as a second  file
     in the list.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ARRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH.

I scroll back and read the whole screen:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
     When any of the grep utilities is applied to more  than  one
     input file, the name of the file is displayed preceding each
     line  which  matches  the  pattern.   The  filename  is  not
     displayed  when processing a single file, so if you actually
     want the filename to appear, use /dev/null as a second  file
     in the list.

OPTIONS
     -b   Precede each line by the block number on which  it  was
          found.  This is sometimes useful in locating disk block
          numbers by context.

     -c   Display  a  count  of  matching   lines   rather   than

          displaying the lines which match.

     -h   Do not display filenames.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The iron spike of enlightenment finally punches through into
my cerebellum "... ... ... so... so... so... you
mean... there's ANOTHER reason why Emacs always appends
/dev/null to its m-x grep command-line! ... Well f__k me
harder again and again! ...  errgghhhh... FEELINGS are
cascading over me!!!"

Incidentally (or not -- YOU be the judge!) this is EXACTLY
the kind of bullshite which makes the "ls" command lose so
badly (and which, incidentally, contributes to every unix
FTP server flagrantly violating the FTP spec): the default
filename argument for "ls" (the current directory) is
totally different from specifying "ls * .*" (which one might
think would be the same thing) because bloody cretinous "ls"
descends into subdirectories which are specified on the
command-line, even those without a trailing "/" (even if
unix had some command-line convention to discriminate
between "the directory" and "the files of the directory",
which it doesn't) and even those which are a result of a
wild-card expansion (even if unix commands knew anything
about wild-cards, which they don't.)

(I won't even start to rant on the matter of needing ".*" in
addition to "*" to get all of the files in a directory.  I
won't.  I won't.  I won't.)




Anyway, I now feel so much better for knowing why Emacs does
what it does.

I'm now a grep wizard!  I can probably get a job as a
high-powered unix system administrating consultant, the sort
who just recently hosed three day's of my mail.

Likewise,

    I've always thought that if Lisp were a ball of mud,

That comparison of Lisp and APL is due to Alan Perlis - he
actually described APL as a crystal.  (For those who haven't
seen the reasoning, it was Alan's comment on why everyone
seemed to be able to add to Lisp, while APL seemed
remarkably stable: Adding to a crystal is very hard, because
you have to be consistent with all its symmetry and
structure.  In general, if you add to a crystal, you get a
mess.  On the other hand, if you add more mud to a ball of
mud, it's STILL a ball of mud.)

To me, C is like a ball.  Looked at from afar, it's nice and
smooth.  If you come closer, though, you'll see little
cracks and crazes all through it.

C++, on the other hand, is the C ball pumped full of too
much (hot) air.  The diameter has doubled, tripled, and
more.  All those little cracks and crazes have now grown
into gaping canyons.  You wonder why the thing hasn't just
exploded and blown away.

BTW, Alan Perlis was at various times heard to say that
(C|Unix) had set back the state of computer science by
(10|15) years.

The original 3D filesystem done by Dave Korn (of ksh) and
Phong Vo (of systemV curses, and systemV fast malloc) (Glenn
Fowler (of nmake) might be in there too) works _entirely_
with shared libraries.  The first implementation of it used
a new filesystem type in the kernel (running on a 3b type
machine), but once they got SunOS style shared libraries,
they went that way.

There have been numerous spin-offs of their work (mostly
based on a USENIX talk they gave on the subject) which
include Sun's translucent filesystem and the 3D filesystem
in Plan 9.

The fundamental concept of 3D is that ... represents the
previous version of the current directory.  In other words,
when you create a new version of a directory, all the files
in old version appear to be in the new version as well, but
when you write new copies of those files, the new copies
don't appear in the old version of the directory.  Think it
as if you created the new version by making a bunch of
sym-links to the old versions, and then destroyed a sym-link
before writing a file.

They're currently working on newer stuff which uses has
security/control/concurrency/etc features, but looks mostly
the same to the casual user.

Ahh, I just feel like shaking their little heads while
grabbing a 200dB megaphone and politely informing them that
THE NAME ISN'T ZORG like some bletcherous cyborg from the
brainwashing television cartoons, nor DOES IT HAVE ANY
REMOTE CONNECTION to the KLEENEX of operating systems that
they happen to be using on their underdesigned workstations.
Get in to your TINY LITTLE HEADS that there are other things
than UNIX out there.  Study your HISTORY for Gads sake!
Don't just look ten inches in front of your noses and
believe that the world ends there.

OK, so I received this message just after having read a
column in a so-called "professional publication" that spent
a whole page on discussing the boundaries between
worktations and PCs.  MS-DOS here, UNIX there, OS/2 in
between.  Then I read "With the introduction of NT, the
answer to 'When is a PC a workstation?' is moot".  Like, who
cares what it's called anyway; just give me something I can
work with!  Besides, I'm really SICK and TIRED of reading
about how some future, unreleased and most often not even
conceptually defined product is going to save the world and
make everything else obsolete.  And then people talk about
it as if it already was reality.  "Well, yeah, you may do
distributed objects/3D graphics/multimedia mail today but
Taligent/Windows NT/Solaris 2.0 will make all that better
tomorrow."  Yeah, really, just like ACE.  And people believe
this?  ARGH!

I feel better now, I really do.

Just set the permission on the .mh_profile to read only. The

For some time now I've been puzzled by the named

Oh I know that supposedly it stands for "new technology".

Recently a new conspiracy theory was brought to my
attention.  Do you remember the mess with the choice of
"HAL" in the movie 2001?  If you incremented each letter
forward one you came up with "IBM".  Of course they denied
everything.

Well someone pointed out today that if you took "VMS" and
incremented each letter forward by one you get "WNT".

Chalk one up for Dave Cutler.  I hate to blow the cover on
this one so early.  I'm certain that everyone involved will
deny this and claim this is just a coincidence.

This is why the Unix guys all hate it so much.  Clearly
their subconscious is flashing alarm signals at them, but
they don't really understand why.  Well now you know.

And I thought they just wanted to dump out corrupted

Not only do you have to handle ioctl's which get called
using the ioctl syscall.  You also have to handle the
ioctl's that get called via the fcntl syscall and the
setsockopt syscall.  Oh yeah, and then there are some fcntl
ioctl's that can be called by the dupx syscalls.  [Let me

Subject: Unix Corrodes Hardware Design At Sun 




    I can see the unix brain-rot creeping all over Sun, now.

	I have occasion to be in the middle of the design
for an Sbus card (you know, that "Open" bus in sun unix
boxes these days -- if you're lucky, when you receive your
machine sun has condescended to actually leave one of them
open for you to put something of your own (or someone
else's) into).

	Sun, seeing the need for high-level hardware
modelling in today's complex systems has developed a set of
models in Verilog (a popular hardware description language
due to the fact that it looks much like C....) for driving
and monitoring the sbus hardware.  However, it's quite clear
that the unix mindset which the Sun engineers have become
accustomed to has crossed over into their hardware design
and modelling.

	First, they provide a model that only works with a
special patch to Verilog (which they don't bundle in with
their hardware model).  Now this patch actually deals with
the fact that Verilog inherits some braindeath from C and
apparently you can't get at some of the information Verilog
is storing around unless you go outside of Verilog to do it.

       Sun's routines model various sbus transactions, but
they don't give you an actual handle on the data to, say,
check if it's correct.

       Just like their network code, there are large
portions of this code which have clearly never been
used/tested.  To check timeout on the bus, they look to see
if a certain *8* bit counter has counted up to 256.  But
that's ok, if the counter was big enough, then you'd
discover that they actually didn't have any part of the
model sitting around ready to model the things which are
supposed to happen when timeout occurred (after all, since
the counter never reaches 256, the bus never times out ---
why have useless code around when it's not needed...).

	No wonder they've had so much troubles with
SuperSparc....

   What's wrong:

        CALVIN is running 7.4, and appears to have a bug.
   Instead of displaying the message:

   zwgc: Unable to open X display -- disabling X driver.

   zwgc: To receive Zephyrgrams, (type `/usr/loki/bin/zwgc

   it runs a zwgc with a DISPLAY :0.0

   This causes zephyrs to pop up on the idle login screen,

   7.3 machines.  This bug is reproducable.

   What should have happened:

       It should have displayed the warning message and not

   Please describe any relevant documentation references:

   --[9434]--

 This occurred because someone started inetd by hand on
 podge with the DISPLAY environment variable set, and your
 rlogin process therefore inherited the variable setting.

 People who find it necessary to kill and restart inetd on
 workstations should be careful when doing so of the
 environment they propogate to inetd when they restart it.

 I have killed and restarted inetd on podge without DISPLAY set.

Subject:  Two wrongs make a right

Those of us who are aware that denial results when the
output queues for peripherals overrun are aware that it can
be devastating, but there are also those of us who take
advantage of it as if it were a feature.  Here is what
happened to me today.

          On a 3B2, the system backups and restoration
program does not allow you to restore information to
different directory structures than it was backed up from
without great difficulty.  I happened to have over 9,000
files to restore to a system, and they were backed up from
"/v", but the system they were being restored on had only a
"/u" it would fit on.  (These are Unix subdirectories).  As
a result, I essentially had to do the restore to a newly
created "/v" in the root file system, which did not have
enough file space available to do the entire restore.  I had
a plan - As the tape was restored, I would copy disk-to-disk
and delete the incoming files after copying them.  I have
done this "race" before, and I knew that I had to transfer
out at a rate high enough so that the root file system would
not overrun - which is to say, I had to beat the incoming
tape transfer with disk to disk transfers.  Of course the
tape in streaming mode operates faster than the disk I was
using, so in the end, it was helpless because it takes two
disk accesses to move a file from one disk to another, but
only 1 access to get a new file from the tape.  I tried
putting in multiple transfer processes at high priority, but
of course, the DMAs always won from the tape to the disk.

          The solution I used (when the available space
began to get critical) was to halt output on the console!
Hard to believe it works?  Of course it does.  The tape
transfers produce a dot on the screen for each of the files
transferred in, and by pressing <ctrl>s (stop output) I was
able to block the tape transfer process after only a few
hundred more files are transferred.  By watching the disk
space, stopping the console output to block tape transfers
when space got too low, and continuing output when more
space was created by the transfer to the second disk, I was
able to complete the job.

          The point of this insanity is that as a practical
matter, there are times when knowing how to cause denial of
services can be a very useful part of systems administration
- especially when we can do it so selectively.  The title of
this piece indicates that by knowing about how to break a
system, I was able to compensate for one flaw in the system
by exploiting another flaw - hence, 2 wrongs made a right!

P.S.  I am interested in other stories where known holes
were used to compensate creatively for other known holes.
It is my contention that most of the best systems
administrators and systems programmers know about and
exploit these sorts of things all of the time, and that
without these flaws, we would really have to design systems
right - otherwise, we would never be able to make up for the
wrongs with other wrongs.

The following was posted by a system manager at a site I
use.

Now, we all know that software has bugs.  On every system.
But Unix and X bugs are somehow different.  Stronger.  More
distressing.  More consistently dumb.  More clearly based on
a programming philosophy that says "oh, no one would ever
want to do that.  After all, *I* never want to do that."

Somehow, these just seem to scream UNIX!  X!  at me.



I had some complaints about IslandWrite/Paint/Draw.  Based
on them I have updated the man pages for both that software
and Wingz, to explain some setup issues.  Please see the man
pages for details.  Here are the issues:

1. Island software causes the X server to exit, when on a
color display.  It turns out that twm (the window manager)
coredumps.  The way X is designed, if you lose the window
manager, X exits.  We are about to start moving from X11R4
to X11R5, a somewhat newer version of X.  The version of twm
in X11R5 does not have this problem.  Thus the man page
recommends that you change you path so that you get the
X11R5 software.  This will not take effect until we have the
X11R5 core distribution on our systems, which should happen
by the middle of next week.

2. Island software, particularly IslandPaint, appears to
hang the machine on startup.  It isn't actually hanging the
machine.  It's just causing it to page very heavily for a
very long period of time.  The problem is most noticable on
color displays with small memory.  It appears the the
software is constructing the file menu for the current
directory.  It does this before putting up the first window.
Unfortunately they are using disasterously slow code to
construct the menu.  It appears to be N**2 in the number of
files.  If you have a very large directory (several hundred
files -- this may be a problem only for staff), you may see
this.  If so, we suggest creating a subdirectory for your
Island files, and cd'ing to it before starting the Island
software.

Step 3 into hell: I am obsessed.  Somewhere from the dimness
of my memory I recall something about the line speed
affecting the redrawing.  The unix PERCEIVED line speed,
which of course bears no resemblance to the actual line
speed I am communicating at. I think lets try stty baud
2400.  The answer "extb".  Ext what?  A quick check using
"stty everything" reveals that baud is still "38400".  I
have a 9600 baud modem.  (note for the historians: a modicum
of sensibility: the word "everything" in a unix command,
causes me to relax when invoking it.  I am pretty far gone
by now).

Of course this doesn't change anything. It doesn't fix my
problem.  It makes me swear.  I was swearing before I
started the process.

Step 4 into hell: I give up. Actually, that is a step back
to sanity in unix.  But several days later another dim
memory surfaces.  Perhaps I should read the manual to see
how to set the baud rate.  Sure enough it I need to do "stty
2400".  On a real computer you now see garbage on the
screen, as your modem tries to talk to the uart 4 times
faster than it is listening.  Seeing THAT would have made me
happy.

Hell: It works.  Screen updating makes sense again.  My
problem is solved (heh heh).  I am happy.  I think this is
the moment when the little red light in my hand is supposed
to go off asking me to report (docile please) to the
termination center.

Purgatory: I wonder why this works. 

DONT SEND ME OR THIS LIST ANY REASONS. DONT SEND ANY
PLATITUDES ABOUT THIS BEING STANDARD UNIX BRAINDAMAGE. JUST
DON'T.

(and mourn for soul if you happen to have some problem that
this message inadvertantly helps solve, and you fall asleep
with a smile on your face, happy with a day's productive

    Bill Joy Golden Edition Delivered To Customers On Schedule

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 23, 1992 -- SunSoft today
announced the on-schedule shipment of the Solaris 2.0
software environment, the culmination of one of the computer
industry's most ambitious software undertakings. Requiring
more than 1,000 man years of development time, Solaris is
the first system software product to combine the features of
high-performance computing -- such as multitasking,
multiprocessing, multithreading and network security -- with
the ease of use of a personal computer bringing
traditionally expensive commercial and technical computing
processes to mainstream desktop computers. In addition, it
is the only software solution available today that provides
a compatible path to next-generation object-based computing.

Solaris 2.0 will ship to customers worldwide in a special
limited edition Compact Disc (CD) package -- the Bill Joy
Golden Edition.  Signed by UNIX pioneer and Sun cofounder,
Bill Joy, the gold CD encapsulates 32-bit power,
industry-standard networking, a robust developer environment
and a 3-D multimedia desktop. The Bill Joy Golden Edition
will be shipped to customers, including Toshiba, CompuAdd,
Solbourne, Tatung and Sun Microsystems Computer Corp. (SMCC)
beginning next week. These companies design computers based
on the world's most widely used RISC microprocessor, SPARC.

There is an arcade game called Block-Out (or something like

on the stack of blocks and rotating wireframes in 3space.
But that's not the point.

The point is that when a round ends, this big Oz-head comes
onto the screen, growling something at you with way too much
reverb for you to be able to understand anything it's
saying, and as it's doing this, the background has a list of
UNIX error messages scrolling by, with such classics as

	core dumped
	bad system call
	too many links
	fsck failed
	not a typewriter
	hangup

and my personal favorite

	network is unreachabl

(In the true UNIX spirit of fixed-size buffers.)

So now whenever Unix shafts me, I get an image of this giant
Oz-head guy, YELLING at me with way too much reverb.

I am not a trigraph advocate but have just put at least one

the problem arises in code that compiles under classic and

	#if _ok_to_use_pragma_foo_
	#pragma foo
	#endif

this is ok for __STDC__ but some classic compilers complain
about the undefined control #pragma and terminate

the first attempt indented the #pragma by a space/tab, but
some non __STDC__ hybrids still choked

the trigraph solution is

	#if _ok_to_use_pragma_foo_ && _ok_to_use_trigraphs_
	??=pragma foo

    The following STREAM devices are mentioned in the SVr4

            /dev/icmp 	- Internet Control Message Protocol

    These should be present in Solaris.  /dev/tivc allows
    you to do some neat things if you need to write
    protocol independent code (you can supply a set of
    protocol characteristics --- eg. connection oriented

Why would anybody want "protocol independent" code anyway?

	I particularly like the part where it says there
were no errors right after announcing how it didn't remake
things because of errors.  Perhaps "Don't know my own name!"
(followed after a bit by "demo-26 has been set up ..." is a

Date: Thu, 09 Jul 92 13:44:46 +0100

It's a conflict of interest, Crocker. Your company has
business dealings with a company which I have vowed to
destroy. Do you deny that SAAG is concerned with TAP's
possible competition with cryptographic protocols?

  ``I am concerned that if we were to progress the RFC it
  would be interpreted as being suitable for
  authentication, in lieu of the other, higher assurance
  mechanisms now under development.'' (SK, last December.)

Do you deny that PEM is a ``higher-assurance mechanism''? Do
you deny that TIS has a financial interest in the future of
PEM?

You can't have it both ways. SAAG has held TAP back for a
year with the excuse that TAP could delay widespread use of
cryptographic mechanisms.  Now that we've discovered that
you have a *financial* interest in those cryptographic
mechanisms, are you going to lie about SAAG's position?

An honest man with a conflict of interest will admit the
conflict and take steps to remove himself from the position
of difficulty. In this case that is the position of
controlling TAP's future. Remove yourself!

All your rhetoric about ``the overall operation is strongly
driven by consensus'' can't justify your actions. You
singlehandedly replaced me with SJ as chairman of the
effort. Then SJ, without checking with the Ident group, cut
the TAP document out of Ident's agenda. And then you threw
me off the SAAG mailing list.

That's not how consensus works! An honest man doesn't
attempt to achieve ``consensus'' by cutting his opponents
out of the process. Nor does he abuse a position of power
just so that he doesn't have to listen to something he
disagrees with. People working towards consensus normally
state their concerns and build on top of each other's
suggestions, incrementally. Your actions have been anything
but incremental.

You say ``The ident spec is close to complete and should
soon be ready for advancement to Proposed Standard.'' Weird:
According to PG, you said exactly the same thing two months
ago. Neither time have you presented specifics to back up
this claim. So how about I present specifics: There are
twice as many complaints about the current Ident draft now
as there were two months ago (even ignoring my objections).
Two weeks ago I sent Ident a list of 73 unresolved problems;
by now 6 of them---under 10%---have been settled. The
auditing restriction issue, which has been identified by
both sides as crucial, has made zero progress.

Most importantly, nobody has any implementation experience
with Ident.  IDENT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH CURRENT USE OF TCP
PORT 113. Do you deny this, C? I will never support any
attempt to cripple TAP by ``standardizing'' a quite
different protocol which uses the same port.  (SJ refuses to
change the port number. Why?)

And SJ *still* hasn't said anything about an Ident meeting
at the Boston IETF.  How can the working group be expected
to finish its document when the working group chair neglects
even his most basic duty: organizing meetings? (``Pssst, SJ,
how about the five of us get together and hold a dummy
meeting to finish crippling the protocol.  Don't worry, I
won't mention it to the working group, so nobody who objects
will show up.'')

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


          CISCO SYSTEMS PAYS DEC FOR STOLEN SOFTWARE
		"WE'VE ALWAYS USED IT" SAY FOUNDERS

MENLO PARK, Calif., April 1, 1992 -- Cisco Systems today
announced that they will pay an undisclosed sum of money to
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in return for the rights
to incorporate software from DEC's "TOPS20" operating system
in Cisco's market leading routers and communications
servers.  "TOPS20" was the operating system for DEC's line
of 36-bit computers, which were made obsolete in 1983.
Cisco officials admitted that Cisco routers have used tops20
code since Cisco's founding in 1984, and that Cisco felt
they should "come clean" now that are in a sound financial
position.

Cisco founder LB, contacted at his new company, XKL Inc,
commented: "The same software technology that allowed
TOPS20, which ran on a machine capable of one or two MIPS,
to support many more users than a modern '30 MIPS'
workstation, allowed Cisco to switch 12000 packets per
second with a 12 MHz 68020, when our competitors were
throwing RISC processors with two or three times that clock
rate at the problem, and only getting half the end
performance."  Mr. LB felt that DEC had abandoned the
software, and had no moral qualms about "borrowing" it for a
completely different end product.  "We knew a large number
of 20 hackers, so it seemed a natural thing to do at the
time.  But Cisco is more conservative now, and I guess they
are playing it safe [by paying DEC].  I had planned to add
an additional 4 bits to the router CPU hardware so that we
could make use of even more of the tops20 software, but this
was no longer acceptable, which is why I founded XKL."
Another of Cisco's founders, who asked not to be identified,
added that the original Cisco router's cooling fan and color
scheme were also inspired by DEC's TOPS20 systems.

DEC's reaction to Cisco's volunteering to pay for TOPS20 was
mainly one of surprise.  "Once we found someone who knew
what they were talking about, even he was surprised that
there could still be money involved.  Still, times are hard,
and money is money, so we aren't complaining."

It's amazing what you can do with the Columbia command

Although this is a bit of a hack, I thought it might amuse
some of you and maybe stirr up some nostalgic memories.  So
sit back for a moment and imagine that all those bletcherous

Do you remember the time when commands actually spelled out
their actions?  Do you remember when the command interpreter
knew about the context in which you typed and guided you
through the command's completion?  Do you remember when you
could delete a file and actually get it back again?

Subject:      Ongoing Explain Ramblings

  (no one has complained and at the ZIT i said i would
   comment on potential interesting aspects of implementing
   EXPLAIN, since i think i am the 1st)

 A major thing i am doing with explain (yes it is partially
functional for me) is sending over a "display language"
which tells how to put a record on a user's display. Most is
straightforward like
    if (field 1) display field1
    if (field1 and author=waldstein) display "why read this??"

but several constructs raise issues:
    + Unix shell escapes, e.g.  "time = `date`"

      I think correctly the client should do this, since
      sometimes the info found is related to the
      user/system/setup doing the display. However,
      security is involved, clients may not want to know
      Unix shell, etc.  So i am evaluating these at server
      end and sending them expanded.  I do not think this
      is right, but so it goes.

    + Environment fetches ( ${NAME})

      AM doing these as above with same problem with this
      being the wrong way.  Note one application I use for
      this is we set MYLIBRARY in a users environment and
      do a display line
          if (${MYLIBRARY} ~ 049) display "Your library has this"
      This functionality is being lost unless the clients
      knows/learns that the 049 is holdings and MYLIBRARY
      checks it.

    + #include filename
      displays bringing in displays. What a mess, but i
      think they must be relative data on the server (or
      maybe the include is to another server to do a Z39.50

Perhaps a little explanation of why it's unreliable would
do.  The cause is, as almost always when we discuss
malfunctioning mail software, a virus known as "sendmail"
which has infected a number of systems using BSD Unix, and
has yet to be given the proper attention, i.e. be removed.

The Return-Path header is supposed to be inserted upon final
delivery of the message, as far as SMTP is concerned.  This
may not always be final delivery to the user, though, but on
the Internet, it is.  Now, this bogus SMTP daemon and mail
ravager, sendmail, inserts Return-Path headers at will and
does not obey the standard.  And, which is more, it believes
that when a message has a Return-Path header, it should not
replace it with a good one.

The Return-Path is thus meant to be reflect the envelope
sender, as SMTP sees it, and it should, theoretically, be as
reliable as bouncing mail at the SMTP level to bounce it at
the application level.  Not so in practice.  Thanks to
sendmail.

Help stomp out sendmail in our lifetime.

I like the "transcript" -- it looks like the mailer is
running under CLIM.  ("lock t (clim) permanently locked -
consult a guru")

In fact, that would explain the voluminous error-message, as
I've seen very few unix utilities which provide any sort of
error-detection, and those that do usually have inaccurate
error-reporting, and those error-messages which are accurate
are usually terse to the point of meaninglessness, and those
that aren't don't offer any sort of real diagnostic, and
those that do offer no suggested remedy.

Besides, unix programs don't use locks.

One thing I don't understand is why the distinctly ween-oid
word "guru" appears in the same breath as "clim" and "lock".
Perhaps miniscule "clim" means something different from
CLIM?  "c"onfused "l"imited "i"gnorant "m"ailer?

	After 15 years in the industry, I think it's quite
fair to say that the UN*X "philosophy" generates,
encourages, and enshrines bugs and bugginess.  Who can say
whether any particular bug would (or would not) have
happened if what RPG refers to as "the MIT approach" had won
the day?  All I can say for sure is that things are much
worse than they need have been.

	As for competence, well, it seems to be a moving
target.  I'm tired of hearing described as incompetent
anyone who doesn't want to spend as many hours as the
accuser has grokking the stupidly arcane mysteries of a
1960's poor-excuse-for-an operating system.  Un*x is too
hard to maintain, requiring far too much undocumented
knowledge, and that's *why* there are so many "incompetent"
adminstrators.

	Your mentioning the KLH-10 in a pro-un*x message to
unix-haters (the charter of which specifically prohibits
saying anything nice about un*x or conveying useful
information: it's *supposed* to be biased) is the rough
equivalent of smearing the Torah with shite in a synagogue.

Good thing you didn't CC this apologistic aside to
Unix-Haters, else we would have had to chastise you...  (And
please pardon me for CCing this reply to Unix-Haters -- it
inspired a flame.)

Of -course- mail to Unix-Haters fails to blame any
particular responsible individual.  -Every- little bug or
problem is actually the responsibility of some individual,
if you could only figure out who.  The problem is that
dealing with Unix seems like a grand game of finger pointing
and pass-the-buck (without Harry Truman).  Is the real
problem that the programmer didn't check the array bounds?
Or is it ultimately the fault of the designers of C for
designing a language in which programmers must error check
array indices manually?

Eventually, you stop caring about the details that would let
you sort out who was responsible.  Recently I was unable to
use FTP on a PC to send a file to my directory on a Unix
machine because on the Unix box I use the `bash' shell.
Heaven help me, I even understand why this restriction
plugged yet another security hole in Unix, and I was able to
remove the restriction as soon as I understood what was
happening, but after enough absurdities like that, your
average user has no energy left to assign blame.  What do
all these bad experiences have in common?  Unix!  Thus, Unix
is the problem.

Hell, Unix even -encourages- this phenomenon.  Contrast what
happens on ITS or a Lisp Machine or Multics when a program
error happens, with what happens on Unix.  On ITS, Lisp
Machines or Multics your program suspends and you are given
the opportunity to debug the problem and perhaps fix it and
proceed.  You are given the chance to assign some blame.  On
Unix -- *blam* -- core dumped.  -Maybe- you can debug it,
but you certainly can't proceed, so why bother?  Ignore that
(huge) core dump file and move on to your next task.

Note that users -like- this behavior.  No kidding.  Ask half
the graduate students at MIT these days -- they -hate- the
Lisp Machine debugger.  All those blasted -choices-.  All
those explainations and questions.  They don't want to know
who to blame -- all they want to know is that it what they
were doing didn't work so they can try something else.

So if I want to -think- about who to blame for my problems,
I'll go use a Lisp Machine (or an ITS or a Multics).  But
these days I use Unix, where I don't have to think.

Subject: RE: Need your help.

Enclosed is your message, as it arrived here.  Plenty of
">From"'s.  (I've added an extra leading "-" to each line to
prevent any further damage along the way.)

I get my mail through MOLA, a commercial service.  The exact
MOLA machines it goes through depends on such factors as the
phase of the moon, the sign of the zodiac, and so on.  Some
of their machines consistently insert ">"; some don't.  At
least one sometimes does and sometimes doesn't, in a pattern
I've never been able to discern.

I've sometimes received duplicate copies of messages from
mailing lists which happen to go through different paths
within MOLA.  In that case, it's easy to compare the two and
see that one has ">"'s while the other doesn't.

I've argued with MOLA about this, but they refuse to
acknowledge that it's a problem - it's just "the way the
Unix mailer works".  The RFC's are apparently just barely
vague enough in some sections to make it possible for them
to come up with interpretations that allow this ridiculous
broken behavior.  (E.g., the RFC's say that messages
consists of ASCII text, and after all what was delivered was
ASCII text, so what am I complaining about?)

There is a another, less common, mailer lossage: If the
first character on a line is ".", it gets doubled.
Interestingly enough, the machines at MOLA that insert ">"
don't double dots, while those that don't insert ">" DO
double dots.  At one time, I had a duplicate pair of mailing
list messages that showed both effects plainly.  Needless to
say, MOLA doesn't consider THIS a problem either.

After much searching and talking with Unix mail experts, I
was able to determine exactly where the ">" is coming from.
In fact, the DESIGN is more or less (well, less) reasonable:
The Unix mailbox file format has no explicit indicator of
the beginning of a mail message other than a line starting
with "From".  So a ">" is inserted by the final delivery
agent (smail, I think) to avoid ambiguity.  The mail user
agent is, I suppose, intended to strip the ">" off, but
since leading ">From" lines aren't touched on delivery,
there's no CORRECT way to do this - and in any case I don't
know of any Unix user agent that bothers.  I mean, what's
one little ">" between friends?

It is explicitly stated in the documentation (to interpret
that word in the very broad way that you have to when it
comes to Unix systems) that mail being routed THROUGH a
system should never be handed to the final mail delivery
agent, exactly to avoid having ">"'s inserted.  However,
it's a common hack to arrange forwarding by having local
pseudo-addresses that simply mail right back out again.
Mail to such pseudo-addresses often gets passed through the
final delivery agent.  Then again, given the wonders of Unix
mail, it's easy to pass even mail that ISN'T sent to a local
pseudo-address to smail.  I suspect that what is happening
at MOLA is that they are using this hack to make my address
equally usable on all their machines, though I only REALLY
exist on one of them.

As for the doubled dot problems - that's a whole other
story.  There is a standard convention for doubling leading
dots to allow a line consisting of just a single dot to
unambiguously terminate a message - the convention used on
some kinds of links.  This is discussed in the RFC's, and if
applied properly, is transparent: The doubling is done at
one end of the link and stripped at the other; it exists
ONLY "on the wire".  To see the doubling, you need to
misconfigure a link so that one end thinks dots should be
doubled, but the other doesn't know that's being done (as
there are other methods of indicating that the end of a
message has been reached).

BTW, the leading ">" bug has achieved immortality.  I've
seen several papers printed in collections, including at
least one in a Springer-Verlag book, that have a line
starting with "<upside-down-question-mark>From".  This is
what you get when you run ">From" through TeX.  Clearly,
someone submitted TeX source through Email....

I wonder what scholars a hundred years from now will make of
this.  An odd late-20'th-century affectation, perhaps?
Somehow related to smiley faces like :-) ?

    Date: Fri, 31 Jul 1992 23:38 EDT
    From: AB

    Of -course- mail to Unix-Haters fails to blame any
    particular responsible individual.  -Every- little bug
    or problem is actually the responsibility of some
    individual, if you could only figure out who.  The
    problem is that dealing with Unix seems like a grand
    game of finger pointing and pass-the-buck (without
    Harry Truman).  Is the real problem that the programmer
    didn't check the array bounds?  Or is it ultimately the
    fault of the designers of C for designing a language in
    which programmers must error check array indices
    manually?

    Eventually, you stop caring about the details that
    would let you sort out who was responsible.  Recently I
    was unable to use FTP on a PC to send a file to my
    directory on a Unix machine because on the Unix box I
    use the `bash' shell.  Heaven help me, I even
    understand why this restriction plugged yet another
    security hole in Unix, and I was able to remove the
    restriction as soon as I understood what was happening,
    but after enough absurdities like that, your average
    user has no energy left to assign blame.  What do all
    these bad experiences have in common?  Unix!  Thus,
    Unix is the problem.

    Hell, Unix even -encourages- this phenomenon.  Contrast
    what happens on ITS or a Lisp Machine or Multics when
    an program error happens, with what happens on Unix.
    On ITS, Lisp Machines or Multics your program suspends
    and you are given the opportunity to debug the problem
    and perhaps fix it and proceed.  You are given the
    chance to assign some blame.  On Unix -- *blam* -- core
    dumped.  -Maybe- you can debug it, but you certainly
    can't proceed, so why bother?  Ignore that (huge) core
    dump file and move on to your next task.

    Note that users -like- this behavior.  No kidding.  Ask
    half the graduate students at MIT these days -- they
    -hate- the Lisp Machine debugger.  All those blasted
    -choices-.  All those explainations and questions.
    They don't want to know who to blame -- all they want
    to know is that it what they were doing didn't work so
    they can try something else.

AB, this excellent flame reminds me of the similarities
between our Federal Government and Unix (tm).  Everyone
knows that it is broken.  Everyone has effectively given up
any hope of fixing it.  Those who suggest fixes radical
enough to have some impact are shouted down as extremists
and impractical dreamers.  Meanwhile, patches to fix
particular problems are made at a furious rate, allowing the
continuous accretion of ill thought out features to suit the
various special interest groups.

The reaction of users to the helpful `core dumped' message
in Unix (tm) is really quite similar to the reaction of the
'90s citizens to problems such as the deficit.  The problem
is so large, so complex, so riddled with politics and
special interest argument, that no sane person could attempt
to understand it.  Rational self interest and
self-preservation requires denial and distancing yourself
>From the problem.

You KNOW that nothing you can do will fix any problem; even
if you, individually, understand it, there is such
widespread ignorance and intentional denial in the populace
that even convincing them there is a problem, let alone
proposing a solution, is hopeless.

The idea that you, individually, have some personal
responsibility for improving the operating system, or the
government, is dead.  No one is expected to leave her
campsite cleaner than when she came.  It must be so, for
what difference can it make when Government and Unix (tm)
ignore the now feeble efforts some continue to make toward
improvement.

Face it, we are not of this generation.  The '90s have
arrived.  Unix (tm), MTV, and the Washington PACs have won.

           This seems a variant on the old bug in
           /usr/ucb/mail where the naive user types "mail"
           inside the mail program, and it starts up a new
           mail job with no "TO" argument, so somehow it
           takes the environment string as the recipient
           and sends mail to

	      vt100@TERM
	      unix:0.0@DISPLAY
	      etc.

      God.  I actually remember enough of the unix
      internals to guess why this is so.  Kind of makes me
      want to get hit by a car so that I can get amnesia.

    Just to satisfy my curiosity, is the mailier not
    checking argc and then winding up nlooking at the
    environment string when it thought it was looking at
    argv[1] or something?

I don't have the mail message handy but is is all too easy
to reproduce despite the fact that we are running in yet
another flavor of unix.

Around here, this is caused by the following atom of
instruction. "...and use `mail -f' to read your old mail".
Naturally, it is only a matter of time before someone does
it inside of mail.

The really funny thing about it is that the mail relay host
seems to have a heuristic of "if I can't understand it, it's
probably a bitnet address".  There's a moral in there
somewhere.

In the midst of TK's wonder posting on "The Politics Of Unix

in THIS posting]:

	The reaction of users to the helpful `core dumped' message in
	Unix (tm) is really quite similar to the reaction of the '90s

	>From the problem.

Note the famous ">From" in the last line.  Question: Did
this start out as "from the problem" or "From the problem"?
That is, does the wonderous Unix software not only insert
the ">" but also force the first letter to upper case just
to help it stand out even more noticably?



Pst.  Rumour: In the next release of System V, the mailer
software will check for any use of the word "Unix".  It will
change the capitalization if you get it wrong ("unix"), and
insert a (tm) if you left it out.  The new licensing terms
will forbid you from disabling this feature, or running any
other mailer that doesn't support it.  Expect similar user
interface enhancements in subsequent versions of the Unix
editors, printer spoolers, text formatters, and so on.

You heard it here first.  Pass it along.

Subject: No Way To Do Moderated Mailing Lists

So I'm on this mailing list for TLA Ourorg Announcements
called, disturbingly enough, "ournet."

And they've continually had flames on the list for people
sending email to the list.  You see, the list is supposed to
be "moderated."


The problem is that UNIX has no concept of how to have a
moderated mailing list.  So they've resorted to giving the
list a reasonable name, "wimpy."  They "moderate" the
list by sending e-mail to "wimpy" as a BCC.

I suspect that sendmail's inability to have a moderated
mailing list is a holdover from this region of the UC
Berkeley campus that is near Telegraph Ave, where lunatics
are allowed to rant and rave all day long.  It has something
to do with Free Speach.  People are allowed to shout as loud
as they want as passers-by.  UNIX extends this concept by
not allowing you to create artificially restricted mailing
list.

   Sorry to clutter your mailboxes, but I have found out by

   have enough access priveleges to

   find out any other details about this list.  What is is about?

1) When you want to find out the purpose of a list, you
should send mail to "owner-list-name", e.g.,
"owner-wimpy", not to the list itself.

2) The "wimpy" list is the redistribution list for the
"ournet" list.  It was so named (i.e., obscurely named) so
that people would not send to it without getting Ourorg's
approval first, since only Ourorg-approved announcements are
supposed to be sent to it.

However, since it has caused some confusion, I have changed
the name of the list to "ournet-do-not-use", which should be
a bit more obvious.

Oh, AB, I think that you're wrong here. 


You see, Project Loki was designed from the beginning to
be an open, platform-independent system to develop
educational software.  So what did they do?  They decided to
go with UNIX.  They bought the propiganda.


They then discovered that they had to rewrite large parts of
it.  The decision to go with UNIX effectively subverted
Loki's goal of developing educational software into a goal
of trying to develop and maintain a networked system of
workstations.

Today, Loki's biggest contributions are the development of
the X window System and Kerberos.  The first is a bad window
system that runs on a bad operating system.  Nevermind that
there were better window systems than X when it was
invented, and that today there are even better ones than
those.  And Kerberos, as you know, is designed to bring
security to an inherently insecure platform, UNIX.  It is so
difficult to use and install that it fits UNIX to a T.

Loki has completely lost guidance --- it no longer
considers writing educational software to be the purpose of
the project (which has, incidently, been canceled).  Just
like the purpose of UNIX is no longer a small, compact
research operating system.

I agree, in general. One of the strongest contrasts I notice
between X windows programs and Macintosh programs is all the
command line options, Xresources, Xdefaults etc. It seems
that X programmers are totally unable to make any kind of
user interface decision, and instead abandon their design
obligations, leaving the question unanswered and passing it
on to the end user to solve. This is done in the name of
'choice' or 'freedom', meaning that if you sit down in front
of someone else's X terminal to simply check your mail, you
have little chance of being able to use the terminal or any
of the applications effectively. I don't want my programs to

JP, that's absurd. 

I can also claim that Unix doesn't support Macintosh email
developments, and (I believe) there's about 5 times as many
Macintoshes in the world as unix machines. 

How come most (all?) unix vendors don't support Applelink,
Stuffit compression, Quickmail, Appletalk zones, Macintosh
floppy disks, AppleShare file sharing, Quicktime, MacWrite
and MacDraw files, etc.? It's not because the formats are
secret or proprietary - all these formats are either public
domain or available at licensing fees far cheaper than
AT&T's.

It's equally absurd to equate the Internet with unix (though
the contamination is pretty pervasive). The Internet and its
essential protocols (finger, telnet, ftp, SMTP mail) were
developed on non-unix machines while unix was still wearing
uucp diapers. Unix is still wearing the same diapers, they
just leak more now and you get to smell it every time your
mail is returned with an incomprehensible error message, or
when you try rlogin on some new machine and your terminal
settings are all fouled up. Forget multimedia, why is it
after 20 years unix can't even get your rubout key right?

Never mind that, there are native Macintosh programs which
support finger, telnet, rlogin, SMTP mail, NNTP news, POP
mail, time, and every other Internet protocol you can think
of. Go over to some mac ftp sites like
sumex-aim.stanford.edu:/info-mac/comm/* and take a look.

There's at least three programs that convert sun audio
formats (of course there's more than one) on the mac - go
check out sumex-aim.stanford.edu:/info-mac/sound/program/*

But I imagine the real reason is that Macintosh users expect
a higher quality of integration, and wouldn't accept the
typical
"bag-of-utilities-glued-with-a-bug-laden-shell-script"
approach that sun users would put up with. Since practically
all Macintosh mail programs inherit multimedia capability
through Quicktime, which is a heck of a lot nicer and
doesn't even require any additional hackery, there's little
incentive to support MIME.

   The problem was not caused by "procmail", it was with
emacs rmail-mode.  Emacs rmail-mode does not lock mailboxes
that are not in the system mail spool directory.  This means
it is not safe to have mailer programs write to these
mailboxes at the same time as emacs is reading from them.

   NOTE: It is safe to use procmail with mm.  mm always uses
"movemail" to read mailboxes.  It is definitely *not* safe
to use "procmail" with the emacs rmail-mode at this time.  A
fix for emacs is being worked on.

_At the Center of Everything Which Is Dying_

You swear you are as healthy as the next person,
Like anyone else you despise pain,
At every election you are innocent of war

But inside you there's a swamp
That keeps pulling you towards it.

Waiting for the next outbreak of the disease,
The next rifle shot, the explosion

Almost as if you had a secret lover
Faceless, waiting for you in a closet

You keep looking for it everywhere,
At board meetings, at every planning session

Sucking possibility of a catastrophe
As if it were a sore tooth

At the center of everything, which is dying
The ooze of pus attracts you,
Soldiers and chronic invalids

Have nothing to do but obey orders,
All the difficulties of life are done for them

As on a sickbed one forgets everything,
centering on the self only

Even when the surface of the onion is pure
Gradually the soft spot, the delicious rot

Keeps seeping outwards
>From one layer to the next

Inside everyone it is possible there's a viciousness,
A lascivious finger beckoning

Pornographic as sex
Without love there's a stink
Inside everyone it is possible

There's a stagnant pool that wants to be fed
New bodies, every day.

    The solution, as any well-seasoned unix veteran will

For me, using "tar" to copy directory hierarchies is the
archetype of what is fundamentally wrong with Unix, the
fundamental wrongness being that in Unix the user is forced
always to say *how it is* s/he wants something done, rather

The notion of using the tape archiver to move a directory

Why stick with the "UNIX" model?  Because it works, and works well.   
Hype
aside, why thow out basic ASCII streams as a fundamental network  
primitive?
(i.e. virtual circuit model with call setup and tear down, more  
commonly known
in the OS community as "login"/"logout").  NT Servers are going to  
get awfully
lonely in mixed environmnets.  Perhaps as lonely as Apple "servers",  
if that
isn't an outright oxymoron.

It is along way from a kludged individual solution, to a clean and  
supported
interface.  Consider also that the most successful example of data  
flow
programming in the world to day is shell scripts and pipes, including  
the true
ease of integration via rsh.  It can even be done under VMS.   Your  
might
change the script language, you might have many of them, but the  
basic
requirements transcends all of them.

Finally, the Internet is not an accident, a foolish standard set by  
committee,
nor an attempt at market dominance...and it has survived and  
prospered on this
"UNIX" model (sic).  Imagine writing your own client program for  
every different
server on the net...of course that is exactly the case with  
Compu$erve.  All
this single source stuff, and where is the improvement...

I think that a new OS needs a little breathing room but that doesn't  
mean its
advocates need to deny what they will be forced to provide by the  
market place.
(You can bet your old friends at IBM once vowed never to violate the  
purity of
MVS/SNA with TCP/IP and its upper level services).

Subject: Unix - The "Special Olympics" Of Business Software

Unix has been trying to pass itself off as a great OS to run
on all those stone-ugly PC clones out there. One handicap
has been the almost complete lack of useful
applications. One pundit called Unix the "special olympics"
of business software.

In other quality-control news (InfoWorld, Sept 21, Page 1):

SOLARIS 2 SHIPS SANS MULTIPROCESSING
OEMs desert OS; few users have it

by Cate Corcoran

Real gold doesn't rust, but the Bill Joy Golden Edition of
Solaris 2.0 - named after Sun's cofounder - is beginning to
look tarnished.

Symmetric multiprocessing, which was promised on Solaris
2.0, is not available, and hardware manufacturers said the
code is too buggy to ship to users.

Sun Microsystems Computer Corp., Sun's hardware arm and
SunSoft's sibling, is the only OEM currently shipping
Solaris 2.0, which SunSoft delivered to OEMs in June. Even
so, SMCC does not automatically bundle 2.0 with its
systems. Customers must special order it on disk.

Relatively few users, numbering in the "hundreds," have
Solaris 2.0, according to Bob Vieraitis, group marketing
manager of systems software and the marketing program for
SMCC.

"2.0 is a semi-beta version," said one manufacturere. "It
has a lot of real small bugs in it. It's nothing we'd want
to ship to a customer."

"... there are still some ragged edges where the road
suddenly runs out," said another.

... <lame excuses omitted>

"We shipped out a 2.0 to customers," said a SunSoft
official. "It's up to them to decide when to put it into
their machines."

Analysts were skeptical about SunSoft's response. Commenting
on SunSoft's "we're there" campaign, which kicked off the
announcement of Solaris 2.0 in September last year, analyst
Andrew Allison said, in the words of Gertrude Stein, "There
is no there there." Allison is editor and publisher of RISC
Management Newsletter in Carmel, CA.

Subject: KRONOS

   From: Someone

   If you have a serial line between your mac and your unix
   machine, then you can run emacs.  The UW program, which
   is in the public domain, will support multiple windows,
   the meta key, and mouse-based text editing under emacs
   (it turns mouse hits into escape sequences).  It also
   supports window resizing, etc.  You run a program on the
   unix end and it and the mac program conspire to do all
   the i/o multiplexing for the different windows.  The one
   problem is that you have to quit out and run kermit if
   you want to transfer files.

This reminds me of TSO and KRONOS.  Remember them?  For the
370 and Cyber 6700 respectively.  They were ``time sharing
systems'' built on top of batch systems.  You actually typed
at a channel, which took the command lines you typed,
macroexpanded them into a huge virtual card deck, and
submitted them to the mainframe as a regular MVS batch job.
The mainframe read the card deck, ran the program, and
dumped your output to what it thought was a line printer,
except it was actually a port on the channel.  The channel
then read the dump and figured out what it meant and gave
you back output on your screen that resembled what you'd get
if you were running a real time sharing system.  Except that
it couldn't always figure it out, like if for instance your
program ABENDed, in which case you'd get screens and screens
full of JCL and coredump.

Come to think about it, unix systems mostly seem to be like
this.  X for instance.  Immense piles of code trying to give
you modern functionality but failing to insulate you from

Well, actually, KRONOS didn't have any vitual card readers
or anything like that.  Command lines weren't virtual batch
jobs, although terminal sessions kind of were.  There was a
PPU program called "1AJ", as I remember, which was in charge
of getting the next line from the command stream and in the
case of timesharing jobs, it would go off and talk to the
tty driver to get it.  If I remember properly, it was kind
of unix-like in that everything looked like a file stream,
but it wasn't byte-oriented.  Perhaps it was more like the
anti-unix: everything looks like a device, including files.
Anyhow, it was conceptually cleaner than TSO.

God, my lost youth...



P.S.  The UW program isn't like that.  It's more like
SUPDUP, but with multiplexed i/o so you can have multiple
ptys.

Huh.  I distinctly remember KRONOS commands that didn't work
dumping the JCL they had expanded into on my screen.  Mind
you this was somewhere in the Lower Permian, not to mention
Iowa, so maybe the relevant parts of my brain have
fossilized and will have to be reconstructed by
paleontologists using the polymerase chain reaction.

The other winNing thing about KRONOS, as I remember it, was
that the Cyber was a 60 bit machine with 6-bit byte
instructions.  Fine for ASR-33s, not so fine for the zyzzy
new glass ttys with (wow!) lower case.  So 8-bit ascii was
stored in 12-bit fields, not packed.  The fake time-sharing
channel knew about this, but the Cyber didn't.  So lower
case worked fine so long as the channel could parse what the
Cyber was saying, but if it didn't you'd get the raw six-bit
output, with every other character making sense.  Rather
like the meta bit in unix.

Maybe KRONOS worked differently by the time you were using
it?  I'd say I had it confused with TSO, but I only ever
used 370s the macho way, with a genuine 029 punch.  Those

I can't understand how an OS that has survived so many years

Of course, Unix weenies probably never restore a backup (if
they even make them), they are too used to having 47 copies
of everything since they can't trust themselves not to type
``rm -rf'' accidentally, the file system not to clobber
their files on a crash, or NFS not to insert 0-pages in the

Subject: Fun With Zone Transfers And Your Friend, BIND


Well, there's a new PD11:<CHIVES.V1.SOURCE>ZT.EXE, which
does have the bitvector stuff fixed.  But it still can't
transfer the TURK.PICK zone from TACOM-EMH1.TURK.PICK, because
the TURK.PICK zone it receives has a bunch of WKS RRs with
the IP protocol field set to all ones.  This is illegal per
RFC-1035 3.4.2 and the Assigned Numbers RFCs.

It appears that this is what BIND does when one enters a
completely bogus protocol keyword in the original master
file: BIND issues a syslog() warning but then goes on to
build a WKS RR with the -1 failure indicator as its protocol
field.  BIND is the antichrist.

These values are also visible in DOMAIN:ARMY.ZONE, and in the output
of a "dig axfr turk.pick @tacom-emh1.turk.pick" command on unix.  The
offending WKS RRs are:

    CAMPBELL-IGNET.TURK.PICK.	518400	WKS	 999.999.999.999
    SHAPE-EMH1.TURK.PICK.	518400	WKS	 999.999.999.999
    VERONA-EMH1.TURK.PICK.	518400	WKS	 999.999.999.999
    NCAD-TEP1.TURK.PICK.	518400	WKS	 999.999.999.999
    FTRILEY-ACRIS.TURK.PICK.	518400	WKS	 999.999.999.999
    GREELY-TS1.TURK.PICK.	518400	WKS	 999.999.999.999

Now, you guys have a decision to make.  Do you want to try
to fix this right, ie, get the TURK.PICK administrators to
fix their zone files, or do you want a patch for CHIVES to
cope with this, or both?  If you want a patch, what should
the patch do when it detects this error?

Following the philosophy of generous acceptance (i.e.,

Huh?  Let's think about this.

Tighter integration of file types to the OS are not a
problem.  In my experience, UNIX offers the weakest file
maintenance offerings in the industry, save for MS-DOS.  In
using Tandem Guardian and VMS I've found that ultimately,
one could:

* Back up files.

* Transfer files.

* Convert files.

...much more easily and safely than with UNIX.  Yes, it was
between Guardian or VMS systems but instead of going into an
"open systems" (whatever THOSE are) snit, read on.

As a result:

* Each RDBMS has its own backup and restore facility of
  varying functionality, quality, and effectiveness,
  complicating support for sites adopting more than one
  RDBMS.

* All existing UNIX backup and restore facilities are highly
  dysfunctional compared to similar facilities under the
  aforementioned operating systems.  They can make only the
  grossest assumptions about file contents (back it up or
  not, bud?) and thus cause vast redundancy in backups; if
  you change a single byte in the file, you back up the
  whole thing instead of changed records.

* Transferring files from system to system under UNIX
  requires that all layers of functionality be present on
  both sides to interpret files of arbitrary form and
  content.  Embedded file systems ensure that file transfer
  is enhanced because the interpretation and manipulation
  facilities will be there even if the highest layers
  aren't (ie: you can at least decompose the file).  Find
  me one person who guarantees they can decompose an Oracle
  or Ingres file (ie: someone who has a product that will
  always do it and guarantees it'll work for all successive
  releases of these packages).

Once one strips away the cryptology, the issue is control.
UNIX is an operating system that offers the promise of
ultimate user control (ie: no OS engineer's going to take
<feature> away from ME!), which was a good thing in its
infancy, less good now, where the idiom has caused huge
redundancies between software packages.  How many B*Tree
packages do we NEED?  I think that I learned factoring in
high school; and that certain file idioms are agreed to in
the industry as Good Ideas.  So why not support certain
common denominators in the OS?

Just because you CAN do something in user programs does not
mean it's a terribly good idea to enforce it as policy.  If
society ran the same way UNIX does, everyone who owned a car
would be forced to refine their own gasoline from barrels of
crude...

   Of course Lint is useless.  It's one of those programs

I was unaware that proscriptions against free()ing pointers
you had never malloc()ed and referencing uninitialized
variables were a recent development, but isn't it great that
we have (void) so that lint doesn't complain when I don't
check the return status from printf()?  Even BASIC has
on-error-goto - too bad Kerninghan and Ritchie couldn't be
bothered to put an error handler hook into the language.

By the way, that free() didn't crash the program.  Unix
memory allocation routines are so nice and trusting - they
just prepend a couple of bytes to your pointer and then add
it to the free list, regardless of where the pointer points
- if you own the memory, you just freed it
(congratulations).  The real fun starts when you do your
next malloc and get a segmentation violation.  In my case, I
was left scratching my head and wondering why 6 calls deep
into getpwnam(3) (a supposedly stable library call, but hey,
this is Unix - there are no guarantees), my program suddenly
segfaulted without the slightest indication why.  Pfft.

   Try giving LINT ANSI-C and see what it does.

Isn't it nice that all the different implementations of
ANSI-C are *less* compatible with each other than PCC-based
compilers?  Standards are soooooo wonderful.

   Try giving the Sun compiler ANSI-C, for that matter.  

With the advent of Solaris, Sun will address that problem by

tar.  Why do you insist on looking at the trivial little
glitches, when so much is right with the world?

(Besides, we all know that "tar" stands for "tape ar", but
here you're using it without a tape - and it doesn't have
anything to do with ar anyway.  Maybe you would have done
better by using rm instead.)

Ah, you started off mentioning "consistent".  Look, there

or more letters.  Of those commands, some require the
options to come first, while others let you write them
anywhere on the line, interspersed with file arguments.  (Of
course, there are finer subdivisions: Single- or
multi-character option names?  If single, can you use
multiple options with a single dash (-ab) or must you use
two dashes (-a -b).  But we won't mention that.)  Those
classes, and all the others I won't go into, form the
consistent Unix user interface.  (Yes, it's consistently a
Unix user interface.  I mean, when was the last time you saw
it change on you - at least between reboots?)

Anyhow, look at your command line.  It's screaming "wash me
please".  No, actually, it's screaming "where's the dash"?
If you're Mister Average American Joe, you know that Unix
options start with a dash.  (Or maybe a plus; but let's not
worry about that now.)  So how come tar's first argument is
an option, but has no dash?

Consistency.  Feh, tar's command syntax isn't in the large
class of consistent Unix command input syntaxes; why would
you expect its output value to be in the similarly large
class of consistent result values?  It's consistent in its
lack of willingness to surrender its freedom of reading and
speech to the petty tyranny of people like you.

Subject: Creative Writing Project

This is an excerpt from a series I started writing last
summer called "Blood on the Bus," when I had to spend a
month installing a unix cluster.  I don't think I'll ever
get around to writing any more of it, so I humbly submit
this miserable fragment of text to uberflamemeister Bawden
as penance for my detestable neglect of proper flamage in
the past.



   Unix was a program gone bad.  Born into poverty, its
parents, the phone company, couldn't afford more than a roll
of teletype paper a year, so Unix never had decent
documentation and its source files had to go without any
comments whatsoever.  Year after year, Papa Bell would
humiliate itself asking for rate increases so that it could
feed its child.  Still, unix had to go to school with only
two and three letter command names because the phone company
just couldn't afford any better.  At school, the other
operating systems with real command names, and even command
completion, would taunt poor little Unix for not having any
job or terminal management facilities or for having to use
its file system for interprocess communication and locking.

   Then, bitter and emasculated by its poverty, the phone
company began to drink.  During lost weekends of drunken
excess, it would brutally beat poor little Unix about the
face and neck.  Eventually, Unix ran away from home.  Soon
it was living on the streets of Berkeley.  There, Unix got
involved with a bad crowd.  Its life became a degrading
journey of drugs and debauchery.  To keep itself alive, it
sold cheap source licenses for itself to universities which
used it for medical experiments.  Being wantonly hacked by
an endless stream of nameless, faceless undergraduates, both
men and women, often by more than one at the same time, Unix
fell into a hell-hole of depravity.

   And so it was that poor little Unix began to go insane.
It retreated steadily into a dreamworld, the only place
where it felt safe.  It took heroin and dreamed of being a
real operating system.  It took LSD and dreamed of being a
raspberry flavored three-toed yak.  It liked that better.
As Unix became increasingly attracted to LSD, it would spend
weekends reading Hunter Thompson and taking cocktails of
acid and speed while writing crazed poetry in which it found
deep meaning but which no one else could understand:

    $sed <$mf >$mf.new -e '1,/^# AUTOMATICALLY/!d'

    make shlist || ($echo "Searching for .SH files..."; \
	    $echo *.SH | $tr ' ' '\012' | $egrep -v '\*' >.shlist)
    if $test -s .deptmp; then
	for file in `cat .shlist`; do
	    $echo `$expr X$file : 'X\(.*\).SH'`: $file config.sh \; \
		/bin/sh $file >> .deptmp
	done
	$echo "Updating $mf..."
	$echo "# If this runs make out of memory, delete /usr/include lines." \
	    >> $mf.new
	$sed 's|^\(.*\.o:\) *\(.*/.*\.c\) *$|\1 \2; '"$defrule \2|" .deptmp \
	   >>$mf.new
    else
	make hlist || ($echo "Searching for .h files..."; \
	    $echo *.h | $tr ' ' '\012' | $egrep -v '\*' >.hlist)
	$echo "You don't seem to have a proper C preprocessor.  Using grep instead."
	$egrep '^#include ' `cat .clist` `cat .hlist`  >.deptmp
	$echo "Updating $mf..."

	    -e '/\//{'							\
	    -e   's|^\(.*\)/\(.*\)\.c|\2.o: \1/\2.c; '"$defrule \1/\2.c|p"	\
	    -e   d								\
	    -e '}'								\
	    -e 's|^\(.*\)\.c|\1.o: \1.c|p' >> $mf.new
	<.hlist $sed -n 's|\(.*/\)\(.*\)|s= \2= \1\2=|p' >.hsed
	<.deptmp $sed -n 's|c:#include "\(.*\)".*$|o: \1|p' | \
	   $sed 's|^[^;]*/||' | \
	   $sed -f .hsed >> $mf.new

		/bin/sh $file >> $mf.new
	done
    fi

Eventually, Unix began walking down Telegraph Avenue talking
to itself, saying "Panic: freeing free inode," over and over
again.  Sometimes it would accost perfect strangers and yell
"Bus error (core dumped)!" or "UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY: RUN
FSCK MANUALLY!" at them in a high pitched squeal like a
chihuahua with amphetamine psychosis.  Upstanding citizens
pretended it was invisible.  Mothers with children crossed
to the other side of the street.

   Then one evening Unix watched television, an event which
would change its life.  There it discovered professional
wrestling and knew that it had found its true calling.  It
began to take huge doses of corticosteroids to build itself
up even bigger than the biggest of the programs which had
beaten it up as a child.  It ate three dozen pancakes and
four dozen new features for breakfast each day.  As the
complications of the steroids grew worse, its internal
organs grew to the point where Unix could no longer contain
them.

    First the kernel grew, then the C library, then the
number of daemons.  Soon one of its window systems was
requiring two megabytes of swap space for each open window.
Unix began to bulge in strange, unflattering places.  But
Unix continued to take the drugs and its internal organs
continued to grow.  They grew out its ears and nostrils.
They placed incredible stresses on Unix's brain until it
finally liquefied under pressure.  Soon Unix had the mass of
Andre the Giant, the body of the Elephant Man, and the mind
of a forgotten Jack Nicholson character.

   The worst strain was on Unix's mind.  Unable to
assimilate all the conflicting patchworks of features it had
ingested, its personality began to fragment into millions of
distinct, incompatible operating systems.  People would
cautiously say "good morning Unix.  And who are we today?"
and it would reply "Beastie" (BSD), or "Domain", or "I'm
System III, but I'll be System V tomorrow."

Psychiatrists labored for years to weld together the two
major poles of Unix's personality, "Beasty Boy", an
inner-city youth from Berkeley, and "Belle", a southern
transvestite who wanted a to be a woman.  With each attempt,
the two poles would mutate, like psychotic retroviruses,
leaving their union a worthless blob of protoplasm requiring
constant life support remain compatible with its parent
personalities.

   Finally, unbalanced by its own cancerous growth, Unix
fell into a vat of toxic radioactive wombat urine, from
which it emerged, skin white and hair green.  It smelled
like somebody's dead grandmother.  With a horrible grin on
its face, it set out to conquer the world.

I believe this is an example of what ksh calls a "tracked
alias."  The theory being that twinkie boxes don't have
enough spare cycles to actually look at the filesystem every
time you use an Important Program.  Since "cat" is the
archtypical example of the unix "tiny tools that do one
thing well" (even if it's never used for that one thing and
its normal use is completely stupid), it is clearly an
Important Program, so ksh needs to track this for you to
allow you to do quickly things you never wanted to do at

The ENOTEMPTY errno doesn't exist under System V Release 4.
So Sun made their rmdir() syscall set errno to EEXIST
instead.  That makes you get

	% rmdir fulldir
	rmdir: File exists

when you try to remove a non-empty directory.  That's not

"BANKS UNDERDRAWN... The banking industry spent over a
billion dollars on technology last year, yet they are not
even close to employing leading-edge tools.  A new survey
... indicates that over 75% of bank computer programs are
still written in Cobol and 84% of banking software is
designed for mainframes, not PCs.  Moreover, 80% of the
software used by banks is over six years old and only 37% of
their locations are networked.  The report reveals most
banks are simply not investigating new advances in computer
applications."  [Communications of the ACM, Vol 35, No 10,
p.9]

A translation:

BANKS CONSERVATIVE... The banking industry spent over a
billion dollars on techology that works, rather than the
latest glitzy play toy.  A new survey ... indicates that
over 75% of bank computer programs are written in a language
appropriate to the task as opposed to trying to force their
models into the latest Object Oriented fad and 84% of
banking software is designed to run on systems that have low
mean time between failures, juggle hundreds of users, handle
huge databases, and push megabytes at high rates, not tiny
little machines that crash with great regularity, are
designed for a single user, if even that, have miniscule
disks, and have bandwidth the approximating that of a
sclerotic soda straw.  Moreover, 80% of the software used by
banks has been fairly well debugged and only 37% of their
locations are open to attack by thirteen year olds with
modems and a lot of time on their hands.  The report reveals
most banks are simply not chasing the latest fad in confuser
science and piddling their money away on recoding working
applications unnecessarily.

So, there's this hack in Unix whereby an executable that
begins with #! (the Unix kernel's clever approximation to
file types) is recognised by the exec syscall, and shifted
to an interpreter invocation. The name of the interpreter is
given on the first line, following the #!, and as an added
bonus you can specify an argument to follow the name of the
interpreter.  One.  One argument exactly.  Well, and the
argument can't be too long.  Like more than 10 characters.
And, uh, it can't contain spaces or anything, because the
"parser" just scans to the next space or newline.  How do I
know the argument can't be longer than 10 characters?  By
losing, that's how.  And then going and looking at the
kernel sources.

How else would you know? 

I guess the same guys that think "The network *is* the
computer" also believe "The source *is* the spec."

Well, OK. Let's grant these bozos this much lossage. It's
still kind of an interesting idea, no? You can transparently
interchange small, interpreted programs with large compiled
binaries.

Ha ha. You wish.

This is Unix, right? So we don't have to make it *really*
work. We'll just sort of fool around, and get it going for
our particular test cases, and hey, we're basically done.

Try the case where the interpreter specified on the #! line
is *itself* implemented by an interpreted script. Now if a
reasonable person were implementing this, it would just
work.  Recursion is a concept understood by most 18-year-old
CS majors.  Apparently this notion escaped the notice of the
BSD/SunOS guys, because on my Unix, one level is all you
get.

Best yet, when it fails, it just silently does nothing. You don't
get any interesting error msg.

No surprise there, I guess.

People like Bill Joy are the reason evolution is such a slow

rhetorical questions.)

The original bug, anyway, is that a process created by

  ? finger
  ? sleep 15

Here I typed C-z to suspend the process created by the while
command From above.

  % fg

After a pause lasting a few seconds, a new prompt:

Perhaps the authors of UNIX have solved the halting problem;
in their system, ALL programs halt, whether you want them to
or not.  Believe it or not, following up on this theory, I
found the following, undocumented system call:

  boolean halts (program p)
  {
    return (true);
  }

Apparently, Microsoft isn't the only company guilty of using
undocumented system calls.  There can be only one reason
that AT&T would hide the tremendous accomplishment of

You Just Don't Understand.  Writing Code To Run Inside
Kernels Is A Hard Problem.  (That's why we have
microkernels; so you can have programmers of average ability
writing system software and not necessarily crashing
everything when it breaks.)  You can't just allow unbounded
recursion inside the Kernel.  You might overflow your Kernel
stack which is of course set at some small wired in constant
in keeping with unix tradition (Simple!).  And of course, No
One Would Ever Want To Specify Another Shell Script In The
#! Line.

I have a machine named EXXON-VALDEZ on my desk.  This was
from when I nominally worked in fault tolerant computing; I
figured it would be good karma to name the machine after a
huge disaster as a precautionary measure.  (I'm quite
superstitious in strange ways.)  Now the hardware has been
replaced and I'm about to name the machine something else.
I'm thinking of the name MBUF.  I suppose it wouldn't be
such a big change; the machine would still be named after a
huge disaster...

Suppose every time you wrote a file out to disk you had to
worry that the disk controller would try to interpret some
of the data you were trying to store as commands that might
reposition the disk heads.  You might have a file named
something like "/etc/diskcap" that every program that used
the disk would have to read and decode before it could use
the disk safely.

Weenies would tell you it was your own fault when you
destroyed your file system because you accidentally tried to
store some data that contained some disk controller escape
sequences.  You might feel that there was an important level
of abstraction missing, but the weenies would
condescendingly explain that ``in-band "escape" sequences''
were a well established idea.  When you explained that

One of the best things about Unix is that you don't even
have to rage at it yourself.  The most loyal users do it for
you.  Of course, they don't understand that that's what they
are doing.  Sometimes, they even think they are pointing out
how MODERN, ADVANCED, and PERFECT Unix is.  Other times,
they ask questions, and get answers, that look oh so
reasonable to those whose minds have been subjected to the
repeated electroshock therapy of Unix use.

Case in point is the following colloquy, from a Rutgers

        Then echo `which vacation` includes a bogus error
        message about xinit.

        It also appears to go wrong if I use other bind

        I'm able to duplicate your problem.  Would you
        consider using ntcsh as your shell?  It doesn't
        have this bug.  This is the free version of tcsh,
        which seems to have replaced it at most sites.  The
        current tcsh is rather unportable.  It's currently
        not being maintained, and I'd rather not try to fix
        it.  We're going to be trying to move everyone to
        ntcsh shortly.  (I think we're going to rename it
        to tcsh, and do something about converting people's
        startup files.)  It's fairly compatible with csh
        and tcsh, except that the bind command has a
        different syntax.  The command you would want in
        ntcsh is

		bindkey '^t' transpose-chars

        For the moment, you don't need it.  However when we
        finally install ntcsh as the default, we're going
        to bind ^T to show a status message by default, so
        you'll want that command.

"Fairly compatible"?!?!?!

        dropped it like a hot potato.  Since xdbx's buggy

        gotten a _lot_ worse, I thought x11ups might be
        worth a second look.  Fatal internal error unknown
        size range (aborting) the first time I trie to
        expand a function, exit status 131.  In neither
        case did I `push' the program very hard.  The code
        is simple, the data is simple, the request is
        simple, boom.  Oddly, the one debugger I haven't
        tried is the one people who know me would most
        expect me to be using, gdb/emacs.  Now I'm going to
        blow time on gdb as well.  Oh, I need this.  I
        really need this.  (Bitching at no-one in

	_Demon Seed_ Ain't Got Nothing on These Boys


I've never trusted computers; my bank makes too many
mistakes with theirs.  Anyway, I found myself in Lexington,
Kentucky awhile back (those dadburned fools turned the
Kentucky Theatre into an indoor pile of bullstuff; it used
to be the only indoor place worth a trip), so I dropped in
on a guy who'd sent me a couple of letters recently.

Well, my knowledge of computers comes from _Demon Seed_, so
I was expectin' eerie red lights and strange things sticking
out from cabinets with lots of beeps and whistles.  I wasn't
disappointed with the Engineering Computing Center; they had
blinkin' lights and beeps to spare.  They *said* that
nobody'd been impregnated by their computers, but the darn
things just sat there and gave off a self-satisfied hum.
The guys there started telling me about "walking disk
drives" and "zombie processes", and I said to myself "Joe
Bob, these guys are working in a digital Drive-In."

These computers have it down pat.  You get to use commands
like "kill" and "chill", and they actually DO SOMETHING!  My
pal typed in "kill 29382", and somebody across the room
screamed in pain!  This was all right by me, and getting
better all the time.  He typed in "chill" and everything
started slowing down, just like old Dr. Freeze in _Batman_
(the original, not the Micheal Keaton bullstuff).  They
chant in weird languages (one thing sounded like
"foo-bang-bar-percent-baz-at-uunet", and it did some voodoo
thing), and they have all these books that nobody but them
can read.  They've got their heart in the right place, too;
every command gives you a dollar sign back, and that's the
'Merican way!

I started to think that some of these guys were Commies,
though, 'cause they were writing in chickenscratch that HAD
to be a Secret Red Code.  I'm talkin' stuff like "int
(*(*(*x)[4])())[4];", and I was sure that the Reds were
gonna send an Eye-Cee-Bee-Em over soon as spit.  Well, they
told me that they were really telling the computers what to
do, just like they did in _Logan's Run_.  That put my mind
at ease, let me tell you.  Then one of 'em started saying
"there is another system", and I thought I was smack dab in
the middle of _Colossus: The Forbin Project_; turned out it
was their idea of a joke.

Then they started talking about 'retiring' a computer; I was
about to ask what kinda pension a chunk of metal got.  They
took some big thing called a 'degausser' and started waving
it over everything.  Well, they told me that it could erase
any tapes or magnetic stuff, and I decided that I'm gonna
get one and head over to the Commie Video people and wipe
'em out.

Well, anyway, I was mucho impressed with the boys at UK, and
I've got some ideas for new movies; I'm gonna call Tobe with
these.

Of course having detected that a vital system daemon needs

Here is clear evidence that X is the Unix of window
"systems."  From the manual page for xset (a Unix program
for controlling X server options):

 OPTIONS

      ...

     bc      The bc option controls bug compatibility mode 
             in the server, if possible; a preceding
             dash(-) disables the mode, otherwise the mode
             is enabled.  Various pre-R4 clients pass
             illegal values in some protocol requests, and
             pre-R4 servers did not correctly generate
             errors in these cases.  Such clients, when run
             against an R4 server, will terminate
             abnormally or otherwise fail to operate
             correctly.  Bug compatibility mode explicitly
             reintroduces certain bugs into the X server,
             so that many such clients can still be run.
             This mode should be used with care; new
             application development should be done with
             this mode disabled.  The server must support
             the MIT- SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD protocol extension
             in order for this option to work.

"Such clients... terminate abnormally or otherwise fail to
operate correctly" is an understatement.  In fact, in
earlier versions of one X server, it was possible to crash
the X server (and all its clients) simply by setting the
bell volume to zero -- using xset itself!

The other night a distinguished and celebrated Doctor of
Computer Science told me he'd be hacking network software
``in C, because nobody takes you seriously if you use
anything else.''

Isn't C the language -you'd- pick for hacking network
protocols and implementations?  The "systems programming"
language with no way of expressing "vector of bits",
complete with the "implementation-independent" inability to
state something as fundamental as "32 bits, unsigned", the
"portable" inability to state "little-endian" and "defacto
standard" mess of the "volatile" declaration?





I know, how about a preprocessor (written in YACC, of
course) which takes C code with embedded "comments" which
look like

/*(define-octet-structure (gif-screen-descriptor :access-type :unsigned-8)
    (width integer-16)
    (height integer-16)
    (* (* cardinal-8

          (color-map-p (boolean-bit 7))))
    (background-pixel cardinal-8)
    (* (padding cardinal-8 1)))
*/

and spits out code for the real, winning C preprocessor to
have its way with?  If only I could do something about the
confusing, parenthesis-afflicted syntax, perhaps I'd have a

Subject: Fun With Ptys

So there I was, just trying to visit a file, which happened
to be on a different machine.  Find-file waits a while, and
then tells me "connection refused."  I have a hard time
believing this, and "M-! ping" tells me that yes indeedy,
that machine is alive.  I switch to my shell buffer and run
ftp, and it connects fine.  So why is emacs hosed?  Well,
after a while, I tried to create a second shell buffer, and
it responded with

  <jz@cardinal:~/> 
  Use "exit" to leave csh.
  <jz@cardinal:~/> 
  Use "exit" to leave csh.
  <jz@cardinal:~/> 
  Use "exit" to leave csh.

  (and so on, some
  round-number-in-base-two-because-of-rampant-weenieism
  times)

  Process shell finished.

You know what that is, right?  It means that I've disabled
the TOTALLY LOSING feature that typing ^D at a shell makes
it blow you out of the water.  But apparently the shell
can't be bothered to make a distinction between the
character ^D and a real honest-to-god EOF on its input
stream.  So it decides that if it gets N ^D's in a row,
really what's happening is that its input stream is closed,
and it should blow you out of the water anyway.

And, of course, those TOTALLY LOSING monstrosities known as
ptys often get hosed in just such a way.  So one of my ptys
is hosed.  The one it keeps trying to allocate next, over
and over.  The one that gets added back to the list of
available ptys after a brief but violent tryst with my
shell, or my inferior ftp process, or whatever.

Well, the only real fix I knew of for this was to reboot,
but I had a lot of state that I didn't want to lose just
because everyone's favorite excuse for an operating system
had developed a hacking cough.  So to figure out which pty
was hosed, I added the line "tty" to the front of my .cshrc,
and started a shell again.  Then, after glancing at the
/dev/ directory, I guessed that chmodding all permissions
away from that pty would make it look allocated.  So I held
my nose and tried it, and what do you know, it worked.
After all, everything is a file.  If you can't express a
concept in the file system idiom, it must not be worth
thinking about.

So blah blah blah, life goes on, and later I decided to
visit a file which happens to be both compressed, and a tar
file.  It uncompressed fine, but then tar-mode couldn't
parse it.  I stared at the raw tar file for a while, and it
really did look like a mess: pieces of the files were
misordered, there were random stretches of nulls in the
middle of the text.  So I was going to tell the person who
had sent me the file that they had botched it before
compressing it, but even though I've occasionally seen NFS
do this, it did seem kind of unlikely, so I tried using the
real uncompress and tar programs just to make sure.

Well guess what.  It worked fine.  It seems the output of
that "tty" line in my .cshrc file was being prepended to the
tar data, because the only real way to run a program is to
start a shell and have it run it for you, and because the
tar format has no magic number or any other way of telling a
valid tar file from a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, it
was only giving up the ghost when it reached the very end.

So why was it that the raw tar data looked like such a mess,
instead of simply looking like it was shifted by the length
of the string "not a tty"?  Because part of the de-facto
specification for what tar files look like is that they are
padded to a multiple of twenty "blocks", meaning 10240
bytes.  Isn't that special.  And what are they padded with?
That's right.  Random data that, in this case, looked
deceptively like what the non-random parts of the file
looked like.

Happy happy, joy joy.

Even if you never leave emacs, you just can't win.

Names and paths are the thinnest layer of filth that allows
you to get files open... "hard" links create two "names" for
one file... Files don't REALLY have names at all, they have
numbers!  I'm sure it all seemed clever at the time....

Suns don't have a realpath command, but the realpath library
routine looks like it's only use is to find the final path
of a file hidden behind a maze of twisty "symbolic" links,

	I'm trying to read the documentation for the PHIGS
Extensions to X (otherwise known as PEX), a 3-d graphics
library for X.  Someone in the X Consortium very kindly
pointed out that this thing (a) exists and (b) that the doc
could be had somewhere on export.

	So there's about four things in the contrib
directory calling themselves PEX, none of which are the
right thing.  Similarly, in the R5untarred directory (god
forbid you should forget to capitalize that R!), there are
four separate trees of likely-looking things.  Finally,
after 30 minutes of wandering around I stumble more or less
by accident onto the correct thing.  Thank god for ange FTP,
doing this in regular FTP (outside emacs) would have taken
four times as long.

	Surprise!  the .ps files mentioned in the README(s)
are gone, guess I'll have to run troff.  Oh good, there's an
Imake file, this'll be *easy* ...

	Well, the Makefile it generates (god forbid you
should forget to capitalize that M!) sort of expects to see
the whole directory structure 'cause it uses some macros
from other parts of the tree.  You know how FTP has this
wonderful option to recursively mget subdirectories?

	You mean it doesn't have that option?  There's no
way to copy an entire tree?  Well, hmm, let's see about
running 'rftp', an expect script that gives you (among other
things) this functionality.  I snarf a copy of rftp from my
machine, stick it my bin dir (on my path), rehash, and:

> % rftp export
> rftp: Command not found.

	Hmmm.  After some futzing it turns out that #! scrod
me again, what it means is that *expect* doesn't exist on
this machine.  I back out to another machine that has it,
snarf the tree, and do

> ghoti% xmkmf
> imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config
> ghoti% make
> Make: Makefile: Must be a separator on line 216.  Stop.

	So much for imake.  Oh wait!  There's a PHIGS
subdirectory, with another Makefile.  And it actually *does*
something!

> ghoti% make
> Warning: NAMES changed after being used
> psroff -rj$FORTRAN -ms cover.phigs > draft/cover.PS 2>/dev/null
> *** Exit 2

	Fortran?  Exit 2?  What's this?  Oh, there's this
corefile here - looks like a psdit corpse ...

	Oh wait.  The machine that had expect is running R4!
Hah!  I quickly rcp -r it to an R5 machine, and imake does
me right this time.  Why is it invoking cc?  Oh, I see.  It
needs these 11 C programs in order to properly print the
documentation ...

	Sigh.  Now it's complaining that there's no program
named 'pic'.  I guess that wasn't one of the 11 they thought
they needed.  So I remove the reference to pic (so what if
the figures are screwed up?  It's only a graphics library),
xmkmf again, and make.  Now it's missing some stupid slush
file it probably forgot to create.  I'm touched.  No
'ditroff' either, let's link 'psroff' instead.  A little
more twiddling and aha!  It's off and running a psroff ...

	Half an hour later and I'm suspicious.  I run a ps:
No more processes.  I run another.  Everything looks fine,
maybe 40 processes in the Q.  I run a third: hordes of 'sh
ditroff's.  A fourth: No more processes.  Ps is *so* useful.

	I Give Up.  Rm -r *.

	No wonder people think computers are hard.  I've
just wasted bloody *hours* trying to print the freaking
documentation.  They need better documentation on how to
generate the documentation.  Did I forget to mention that
it's supposed to be 800+ pages?

	We now return you to our regularly scheduled
professionalism.

OK. So I can't print my file. Oh well. I'll look at the man
page.  Hmmm, I must have wanted the "-s" option to
lpr. OK. I'll just queue the job again. But oh, hey wait,
the printer is actually doing something already. And wow
it's printing my document. Oh, actually make that the first
three quarters of my document.

Gee, let's look a little closer at that man page:


NAME
     lpr - send a job to the printer

SYNOPSIS
     lpr [ -Pprinter ] [ -#copies ] [ -Cclass ] [ -Jjob ]
          [ -Ttitle ] [ -i [ indent ] ] [ -1234font ] [ -wcols ]
          [ -r ] [ -m ] [ -h ] [ -s ] [ -filter-option ]
          [ filename ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
     lpr creates a printer job in a spooling area for  subsequent

   ...
   ...

DIAGNOSTICS
   lpr: copy file is too large

      A file is determined to be  too  "large"  to  print  by
      copying  into  the spool area.  lpr TRUNCATES THE FILE,
      AND PRINTS AS MUCH OF IT AS IT CAN.  The  maximum  file
      length  is  specified  by  the  mx  capability  of  the
      printcap(5) entry for the printer.  If no mx capability
      is  specified,  the  default limit is 1000 Kbytes.  Use
      the -s option as defined above to make a symbolic  link
      to the file instead of copying it.


Gee, that's useful. Now if I can just find the flag to lpr
to let me just print the last quarter of my document.... Oh
heck, I'll just print the whole thing again. Too damn many
trees on this continent already.

specify start and end pages.  When I didn't find them, I
looked harder, chasing references, looking in the manuals,
etc.  It didn't occur to me that there just wouldn't be a

I suspect that the True Un*x Way to do this is to print, not
to the printer, but down an Intestine (this is what I call
p*pes) that leads to some parser "utility" that is just
barely general enough to scan for the page headings and
suppress pages that don't have the right page-numbers at the
top.  The result is intestined directly to the stool file --
uh, that's "spoop file" -- DAMMIT! "SPOOL file" -- whose
name you have to know and is different on every machine.  Of
course if you don't do it right (and you won't) a couple of
blank lines will sneak in, and your page headings will come
out about five lines down, preceded by text from the south
end of the preceding page.  Your true weenie won't even try
again, he'll be so pleased at having made this cludge almost
work.

I need hardly say that I do not want to see a gleeful
posting explaining how to do this in gory detail.  I remind
all listening weenies that I have a Symbolics machine.  I
can network to your Ux*x, and when it asks me whether my
local machine has authorized my UID and GID before it lets
me delete your directory, I can simply, and truthfully, say
"yes".  And it will believe me.

the Unix way...



 our thoughts and desires and our relations to one another
 never fit, completely or definitively, within the
 structures we impose upon belief and action.  sometimes we
 conduct ourselves as exiles from a world whose
 arrangements exclude no true insight and no worthwhile
 satisfaction.  but more often we treat the plain,
 lusterless world in which we actually find ourselves, this
 world in which the limits of circumstance always remain
 preposterously disproportionate to the unlimited reach of
 striving, as if *its* structures of belief and action were
 here for keeps, as if *it* were the lost paradise where we
 could think all the thoughts and satisfy all the desires
 worth having.  when we think and act in this way, we
 commit the sin the prophets call idolatry.  as a basis for
 self-understanding, it is worse than a sin.  it is a
 mistake.

I was all set to ask somebody here why I was losing so badly
trying to do something simple (besides the obvious
explanation that springs to mind, of course).  After all,
one of the Secret Ninja Winning Feechurs about UNIX is that
you can stick parts of the filesystem together with links,
just like the adhesions in endometriosis, right?

Clearly, everyone who reads this will see instantly what I
was doing wrong, so here's what I was about to send:

This works:

    [marble] /u/fubar/Dirs> ln -s /net/mc/u/fubar mch
    [marble] /u/fubar/Dirs> la
    total 5
    drwxr-xr-x  2 fubar         512 Nov 11 02:10 ./
    drwx--x--x 24 fubar        2560 Nov 11 02:06 ../
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 fubar          15 Nov 11 02:10 mch@ -> /net/mc/u/fubar

... but this doesn't (and gives weird diagnostics):

    cd /mas/el/microhome/microworld/MediaMOO
    [marble] /u/fubar/Dirs> ls -n /mas/el/microhome/microworld/MediaMOO moo
    moo: No such file or directory
    /mas/el/microhome/microworld/MediaMOO:
    code/
    [marble] /u/fubar/Dirs> la
    total 7
    drwxr-xr-x  2 fubar         512 Nov 11 02:11 ./
    drwx--x--x 24 fubar        2560 Nov 11 02:06 ../
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 fubar          15 Nov 11 02:10 mch@ -> /net/mc/u/fubar

... and this was the same thing again, which gave me
different output and still didn't work:

    [marble] /u/fubar/Dirs> ls -s /mas/el/microhome/microworld/MediaMOO moo
    moo: No such file or directory
    /mas/el/microhome/microworld/MediaMOO:
    total 1
       1 code/

    ... and this is a try a different way, and still didn't work:

    [marble] /u/fubar/Dirs> ls -s /mas/disks/microworld/microworld-home/MediaMOO moo
    /mas/disks/microworld/microworld-home/MediaMOO: No such file or directory
    moo: No such file or directory
    [marble] /u/fubar/Dirs>  

    ... even though a `df' from the relevant directory seems to show that one
    or the other of the above _should_ have worked:

    [marble] /mas/el/microhome/microworld/MediaMOO> df .
    Filesystem   Total    kbytes   kbytes   %     
    node         kbytes   used     free     used  Mounted on
    microworld:/  592502  445810   87441    84%   /tmp_mnt/mas/disks/microworld/microworld-home

So what's going on here?

That's right, I was all set to blame NFS and all sorts of
things like that, when I suddenly spotted that -n up there.

"Uh oh," I thought, "I wonder what -n means when you're
making a link?"  I figured maybe the unrecognized option was
simply ignored without a warning; hey, isn't that the UNIX
way?

Then finally, moments before sending the mail, I suddenly
realized that I wasn't typing `ln' at all, but `ls' instead.

Yes, I had misattributed the blame for my lossage.  It
wasn't the magic of "distributed" filesystems at all, but
instead the shortage of vowels.  LIST and LINK don't differ
by too much when you throw away all the vowels and a
consonant apiece, and of course `ls' takes more options than
you can shake a stick at (quick!  which ones _doesn't_ it
take?  In which "compatible" version of UNIX?), so of course
even the totally screwy call to it didn't reveal a
problem...

The astute among us will realize that what I was _really_
trying to do was to compensate for the lack of a logical
name system by applying pliers to my local copy of the
distributed filesystem, so I could navigate around in this
MUD-like mess without spending the vast majority of my
working day typing pathnames instead of thinking about my
research.

I've since added Yet Another Stupid Alias to my ever-growing
behemoth of aliases that tries to compensate for the lack of
interactive prompting, sanely-named commands, and reasonable
defaults (right, "alias link 'ln -s \!*'", complete with a
comment reminding me that "link fn1 fn2" will actually
create the link fn2@ -> fn1, backwards just like PIP from
DOS/BATCH, RT11, and OS/8 days, what fun, though of course I
can't actually _see_ the comment while I'm typing the
command, oh no, I've gotta go back to the dotfile I defined
the damned alias in to see the comment which tells me how to
use it, so maybe I want a version that insists on two args
and swaps them so it makes sense again), but it's all
hopeless.  All I can say is that the internationalized
version of UNIX in Hebrew won't have to worry about the
vowels, either...

I'm just getting around to responding to this, with an
historical note which I cannot resist.  Paul's paper is a
good, thorough, and competently done analysis, but the
conclusion takes me back about 14 years.  Are we always
destined to reinvent the same stuff every N years?

I wrote one of the 6 original experimental TCP's
commissioned by DARPA, starting about 1978, and my
implementation used exactly the (standard) chained hashing
algorithm that Paul concludes is best.  It seemed to me
then, and still seems, even without elaborate analysis, that
using such an algorithm is simply good software engineering.
I would expect any graduate with a CS degree (and I mean
*undergraduate*) to do the same.  Doing a linear search for
demultiplexing is clearly wrong.

BTW, my TCP was implemented in IBM BAL for the IBM MVT/MVS
operating systems.  What an incredible luxury a good C
compiler would have been!

There is a well known effect in the computer architecture
community, which in summary states that all major
architectural mistakes must be and have been made at least
three times: once in the design of mainframes, once in the
design of minicomputers, and once in the design of
microcomputers.  Perhaps a similar rule applies to operating
systems.

The same mistakes are made once in mainframe OS's, twice in
microcomputer OS's, and N times in Unix (tm) operating
systems.  What seems surprising and different is that they
don't get fixed in Unix.  Mostly people don't even realize
they ARE mistakes.

Sneezy is no longer useable as a build engine, and hasn't
been for a long time.  Right now it requires that one start
3 concurrent telnet's to `eat' enough dead pty's to try to
get a real one with rlogin, and this only works if you stand
on one foot and chant `I know it's a 520 in a server
configuration with no head and a huge case, but it's *still*
a client machine' six times; three forward and three
backward.  I can not count on sneezy as a build engine;
right now, if I have to build something, I end up punting
the rs6k until I can find one somewhere else; (personally, I
usually use one of the two client rs6k's that consulting has
available).  I'm not sure what other people do, but I
haven't seen too many people standing on one foot and
chanting in the XXXX office in a while...

As for `fixing' the problem, when I last cornered
Lusing-IS-type about it, he said that no one, including
himself and IBM, knew what the problem was, but there wasn't
a prayer of getting it fixed for AIX3.1.6, since IBM has had
newer versions of the OS out for so long.  Admittedly, this
was probably a couple months ago.

   Sneezy is no longer useable as a build engine, and
   hasn't been for a long time.

I have not found that to be the case.  It is useable, just a
pain in the ass.

When I need to do a build, I log into sneezy by opening 10
telnet connections to it in the background, and then
connecting to it with rlogin.  This hasn't failed for me
yet.

Yes, it sucks rocks to have to do this, but it is an
exaggeration to say that the machine is "no longer useable
as a build engine."

Subject: Humorous Submissions

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS FOR A NEW BOOK Tentatively titled:
		"Humour the Computer:
	Humorous Writings concerning Computing"

We seek contributions of a humorous nature for a new book
called `Humour the Computer', an anthology of the comic,
amusing and laughable aspects of Computing. It is scheduled
to be published by TLA Press early in 1994.

Topics of interest include:

* computing experiences: e.g. `a day in the life',
  computing jobs - industry, commerce, teaching, research, etc;
  getting funded in the 90's, getting a job in the 90's,
  home computing, how computer people relax, exam marking stories,
  getting published, office politics

* the history of computing: e.g. the mistakes, the
  disasters, the egos gone mad (with names changed to
  prevent law suits), folklore (not necessarily true)

* the future of computing 

* computing in the Real World: e.g. in the media, computer
  salesmen, misconceptions about computing, the misuse
  (abuse) of computing, faulty software/hardware, the
  `training' course

* fake journal articles: e.g. AI, expert systems, machine
  architectures software engineering, new programming
  languages, semantics; surveys of `important' fields:
  Virtual Reality, neural nets, OO, what-ever, etcl

* jokes and cartoons (these will only occupy a small portion
  of the book)

* suggestions for a better name for the collection

Contributions will be judged on clarity, insignificance,
irrelevance, incorrectness, originality, but most of all for
their ability to make the editor laugh. Authors should make
their papers understandable to a broad audience - not too
many `in-jokes' please.

Authors should submit three (3) copies (preferably
double-sided) of the prospective article to the editor;
people without access to a photocopier may submit a single
copy.  Electronic submissions are *not* encouraged.

Each manuscript should have a title page with the title of
the essay, full name(s) and affiliation(s) of author(s),
complete postal and electronic addresses, telephone
number(s), and a 150 word summary.

Contributions must *not* exceed 4000 words (approximately 8
A4 pages typeset 10-point on 16-point spacing, or 12 pages
if typewritten double-spaced).  Shorter articles will be
viewed more favourably than longer ones.

Previously unpublished material is preferred. Contributors
of published material must have copyright to it. All
contributors will be asked to sign a permission letter
giving TLA Press the right to print the material but NOT
transferring copyright.

Submissions must be received by April 3rd, 1993. Authors will
be notified of acceptance or rejection by July 1st, 1993. Full
versions of the accepted articles must be formatted according to TLA Press
conventions, and camera-ready copy must be received by the editor
by August 24th, 1993.

Subject: Every Comment Tells A Story, Don't It...


See, you can tell that I'm only a neophyte weenix unie,
because I try to comment my code.  And I just noticed that
the comments seem to tell a story, below, in some simple
tools I was trying to write:

    # Can't add a "< \!*" to the below or I can't easily use
    # them in filter chains...  But then again, they're
    # unusable anyway!  See below.  So I'll stick in the "<
    # \!*" to make them easier to use on their own (and so I
    # don't wonder why it's taking forever when it's
    # actually waiting for input...).
    # alias words "tr -cs A-Za-z '\012' < \!*"
    # alias lowercase 'tr A-Z a-z < \!*'
    # These are all a crock, because you basically can't
    # make a filter chain by combining simpler verbs if any
    # of them require an input redirection instead of a
    # filename, because you get "Ambiguous input redirect"
    # whenever you actually try to string them together,
    # regardless of types of quoting parens, etc.  So each
    # command has to be _replicated_ in its entirety, rather
    # than calling each individual alias.  Small, reusable
    # tools?
    # What a gd crock.
    # # Input redirection is a problem for the below.
    # # Do I have to stick them in their own file to make them work?  Argh.
    # alias wl 'lowercase | words'
    # alias uniqwords 'lowercase | words | sort -u -'
    alias wl "tr A-Z a-z < \!* | tr -cs A-Za-z '\012'"
    alias uniqwords "tr A-Z a-z < \!* | tr -cs A-Za-z '\012' | sort -u -"
    # God f__king dammit!  Embedded parens around this whole
    # mess STILL doesn't cause the shell to figure out that
    # I want this whole thing run as a single command, hence
    # doing "tolines foo > bar" gives "Ambiguous output
    # redirect".  Doesn't matter whether outside quotes are
    # double (with change of inside quotes to single) or
    # single, or whether parens have a backslash before
    # them.  I just have to do "(tolines foo) > bar" to it
    # to work.  Jesus!
    alias tolines 'fgrep "To:" \!* | sort -u -'

...although the more I look at this file of mine, the more I
notice things along the same theme...

    # Stupid but simple.  Works if nobody has a peculiar
    # name or location.  The story of UNIX: Something that
    # almost works, most of the time.  Ignoring even the
    # possible screw cases in the grep, the only reason the
    # sort even works right is because most finger programs
    # tend to use headings that begin with spaces or
    # uppercase alphabetics, which will sort before the
    # lowercase alphabetics of most UNIX usernames.
    alias dayactive 'f \!* | egrep -v "d (Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)" | sort -'
    alias houractive 'f \!* | egrep -v "(d|:[0-9]*) (Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)" | sort -'
    # alias minuteactive 'f \!* | egrep -v "(d|[0-9]*) (Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)" | sort -'
    # Not dayinactive etc because that would make completion harder.
    alias -dayactive 'f \!* | egrep "d (Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)" | sort -'
    alias -houractive 'f \!* | egrep "(d|:[0-9]*) (Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)" | sort -'
    # The whole thing, sorted.
    alias sf 'f \!* | sort -'

...then we have this winner, because I'm sick and tired of
reading the same damned man page eight times in a row every
time I have to do the same operation (and, of course,
because the _obvious_ command to do this doesn't work in
some lurid way that I recall being discussed here
recently)...

    # Yecch on CP for the fact that I can't use it to copy
    # things!  First arg is fromdir, second arg is todir.
    # You must specify both pretty carefully, especially the
    # todir, since we cd to the fromdir before expanding the
    # todir.  Leaves you in the todir.  Expect to see
    # "tar: Warning: The 'p' option will only restore the
    #       modes of files you own"
    # emitted as a "harmless" diagnostic at the very start.
    alias copy_tree 'cd \!:1; tar cf - . | (cd \!:2; tar xvpf -); cd \!:2'

Of course, most of the entries in my .aliases file are there
to modify the syntax of commands so I can remember how to
use them (or to insulate myself from the common screwups I'd
otherwise make), since there's no such thing as interactive
prompting, noise words, argument checking, or any of those
other wimp things that mere lispheads like myself have been
taking for granted since...  oh, when did Twenex first
become popular?  Before most of the current crop of weenix
unies were born, you say?

Who knows?  Maybe there's some tricky way to do what I want
in all the above mess, and I'm sure that asking the local
Twinkie & Jolt addicts would probably get me some plausible
answer.  Or maybe I could spend another five hours or so
poking & prodding at things, staring it these tremendously
useful error messages that the various shells emit.  Of
course, I could always read the twenty-five THOUSAND words
of nonetheless peculiarly useless description that make up
the man pages for sh, csh, and tcsh, in the vain hopes of
finding something usable in the zillions of ridiculous
little special-case rules about how each little piece of a
command line gets teased apart, in what order, with what
special-case syntax for each part, with the exceptions
listed in the most obscure and offhanded way possible, far
from the actual point at which they'd be useful...  (All the
while, of course, beating myself on the head with a mace,
screaming, "It's _not_ a waste of my time to spend hours
learning this stuff!  _Really_ I'll use this arcane
knowledge again in some _other_ little shell tool.  Who
_cares_ if it took me ten hours to do a task that it would
have taken me about five minutes to write in Lisp?")

The hell with it.  Maybe I'll just throw in the towel and
start learning Perl.  Who was it who called it "like a
vise-grips: the wrong tool for every job"?

I don't regard it a "real" UNIX, then again I wouldn't buy a
"real" UNIX, 1970s software technology is not something I
would want to buy today.

Getting caught up in the "pure" UNIX war will lead you to
restrict yourself to "pure" SVR4 implementations, in the
mainstream camp *only* SUN have gone for this. That in my
view does not make it much of a "standard".

If a vendor decides to do something about the crass
inadequacies of UNIX we should give them three cheers, not
start a flame war about how the DIRECTORY command *must*
forever and ever be called ls because that is what the great
tin pot Gods who wrote UNIX thought was a nice, clear name
for it.

The most threatening thing I see in computing today is the
"we have found the answer, all heretics will perish"
attitude. I have an awful lot of experience in computing, I
have used six or seven operating systems and I have even
written one. UNIX in my view is an abomination, it has
serious difficulties, these could have been fixed quite
easily, but I now realize nobody ever will.

At the moment I use a VMS box, I do so because I find that I
do not spend my time having to think in the "UNIX" mentality
that centers around kludges. I do not have to tolerate a
help system that begins its insults of the user by being
invoked with "man".


Apollo in my view were the only UNIX vendor to realize that
they had to put work into the basic operating system. They
had ACLs, shared libraries and many other essential features
five years ago.


What I find disgusting about UNIX is that it has *never*
grown any operating system extensions of its own, all the
creative work is derived from VMS, Multics and the
operating systems it killed.

If you do that properly it *will* work under windows NT, and
under VMS too.  That is what POSIX is all about. From now on
UNIX will no longer be able to exist as a lowest common
denominator system, the pressure will be to implement the
higher POSIX levels such as threads.


In the long term basing your choice of hardware on the
operating system will no longer be necessary, for VMS to
survive against Windows NT, it will have to be ported to
other platforms. For SUN to continue to sell hardware they
will have to support Windows NT as will HP.

In Ghostscript in GDB mode in Emacs, I typed a command which
printed out a short string:

    GS>12 frobstring ==

Later, I yanked this string back into an expression, and got
what appeared to be a fatal error:

    0x1a7eb4 in read ()
    (gdb) 

Only slightly daunted, I tried to continue, and found it
worked. Of course, this is Unix, so you can continue from
Quit.

But as soon as I typed in the expression, the error happened
again:

    (gdb) c
    GS>/Courier 14 mungefont ( &*y    Program received signal 3, Quit
    0x1a7eb4 in read ()
    (gdb)

Well, by shortening the command line more and more, I found
the problem: The string I had yanked into the command like
contained a CTRL-\ character in it, which caused the signal
whenever I pressed return.

The story you have just seen is true.  Function names have

Now I know that this wasn't a weenix uny who said this but I

Unix developers. If they can't even trust themselves to use
their own code, how can they possibly use and fix anybody
else's code. Everything in Unix is private - the design

            You have no TERM environmental variable.  This
            variable tells the system what type of terminal
            you are using so it's features may be used.

It's worse than that: The last sentence also has a usage
error.  "May" refers to permission; "can" refers to ability.
Setting TERM provides the system with the ABILITY to use
various terminal features; it has nothing to do with
permission, a concept fairly alien to the Unix mindset in
any case.

But the BIGGEST joke is that there is yet another error here
- an error in the use of Unix terminology!  TERM is an
"environment" variable.  There is no such thing as an
"environmental" variable.  (Perhaps that would be a variable
that, if set, prevented you from printing, so as to preserve
trees?)

    Two days ago, /mas/mc/re has 186meg or more of free
    space.  Now there is absolutely no space left on the
    device.  What the hell happened?  How can we re-free
    that space?  This is my primary file storage space
    (having just relocated myself there two or three weeks
    ago from /u), so this is pretty critical for me.

Several hours ago, I started a grep over a medium-sized
directory, writing its output into a file.  I then
immediately took off to a seminar, leaving it running (from
someone's console in Tech Square), came back frm the
seminar, and logged out the job without looking at the
output---I figured I'd do that later.

Suddenly (just after I sent the above bug report), I had a
horrible thought.

I'll bet the more astute among us have already grasped the
problem.  The output file was IN the directory I was
searching, and grep merrily infinite-looped, finding targets
in its OUTPUT file and stuffing evidence of them back into
the output file.

File locking?  Not seeing output files in "ordinary"
directory listings until their output is finalized?  Version
numbers?  Common sense in coding?  Gee, these concepts are
only 30 years old (some are older).  Any one of the above
would have prevented this problem.  It's a real pity that
UNIX still hasn't managed to grasp these concepts.

(I know that the deficiencies of UNIX aren't your folks'
problem per se.  You've got to deal with what the iron
vendor dishes out, as do we all.  I just figured that, as a

Hi all...

I first had an inkling that something wasn't right with
weenix when, in 1984, I was compiling a version of CCA Emacs
(yeah, yeah, I know), on a Convergent Technologies MegaFrame
(don't even start)...I noticed that for some strange reason,
emacs was jumping right smack dab into the middle of the
data space.  Well, as it turned out, the compiler or library
routines, or someone, (they never did fess up) had decided
that "sigtrap" should be an undocumented global variable. I
would have continued a life of blissful ignorance if CCA
hadn't chosen to use it as the name of a function. (Oh,
yeah, I forgot to mention - they only had "adb" as a
debugger. It took a while to figure out just what was going
on...)

With regard to weenix, it's been downhill from there...

I also have to second RS's comment to me that "programming
in C is like smoking cigarettes out behind the schoolhouse
as a kid - you have to keep looking over your shoulder to
see if you're going to get busted..."

        Is this an Ultrix thing, or do disk quotas behave

Mr. A is being hurt by a Unix bug, a bug accidentally
introduced into the file system code when Unix was first
written.

You see, a file is internally described by an inode entry,
which contains 13 pointers to the disk blocks that
constitute the file.  The first 10 of these pointers behave
normally, but a strange mutation occured in some code left
sitting overnight on a disk in a room where the air
conditioning had failed.  As a result of this mutation, the
eleventh pointer came to point, not to a block of the file,
but to a block containing a whole bunch more (like 256)
pointers.  Later on, replication of the erroneous code
fragment due to gamma ray damage made things even worse:
Now, the twelfth pointer points to a block of pointers to
blocks of pointers, and the thirteen to a pointer to blocks
of pointers to blocks of pointers to blocks of pointers (or
something like that).

A result of this bug was the cancerous growth in Unix file
sizes.  Remember that a cancer is uncontrolled growth, in
the wrong place at the wrong time.  In the intended scheme,
no file could be more than 13 blocks long, and most of Unix
was designed around that assumption.  The mutations
introduced the potential for growth way beyond this design
parameter.  Needless to say, nothing has worked quite right
since.  The X window system is probably the worst of example
of metastasized Unix code.  I think it's safe to say that no
piece of X would have managed to survive on a Unix system
with only the original 13 block pointers.

	I am _not_ amused.

        And as far as I can tell, the weekly backup wasn't

It wouldn't have helped even if it had been run.

NeXTSTEP is the object-oriented environment that runs on
NeXT and 80486-based computers. It has been under
development and under marketed by NeXT Computers, Inc., for
the last seven years.

Writing programs for NeXTSTEP is fundamentally different
than writing programs for other computers, because NeXTSTEP
represents a radical departure from conventional programming
environments.  One writes NeXTSTEP programs by building
systems of related but distinct parts, called objects, and
connecting them together to form an integrated whole.
Confining different aspects of a program to different pieces
makes those pieces easier to design, implement, debug, and
reuse. This is what is known as object-oriented programming.

NeXTSTEP embodies the principles of object oriented
programming from its user interface down to its very
core. This greatly simplifies the task of interfacing
application programs with the NeXTSTEP operating
environment. The downside is that it makes the NeXTSTEP
environment very different from the environments to which
most programmers are accustomed: there's a steep curve to
climb when learning to program in this easy-to-program
environment (sounds strange, but it's true).

WRONG.  Don't you understand, PR?  Our goal is to destroy
UNIX.

One of the problems of UNIX is that every lousy user has to
have some sort of magic shell script or alias or
dot-something else and there's all of this knowledge
alegedly floating around, so we spend all of our time
passing around these secrets instead of getting our work
done.

Other operating systems (Macintosh, NeXTSTEP) basically work

Right. This is an Important Unix Concept known as
Distributed Responsibility, or Blame Load Management. I,
personally, feel that whoever first enunciated this
principle captured the essence of the True Unix Gestalt, and
should be given some sort of prize, such as an AT&T 3B2
computer all their very own.

Now, what is going on here is that, if you think about it,
it would make no sense to send that error message to anyone
on the "local machine", because -they've already received-
1873 error messages just today alone, and (here's the key)
-they've come to think it's normal-.  They expect them.
Think about it.  When you saw that message, did you say
"Gee, Bob (this is assuming your office mate's name is Bob),
that mailer over on nohost.nodomain.edu sure is broken; it's
sent us an error message!"?  Did you??  Noooo.  You said
"heh heh, it's the not-a-typewriter thing again.  Haven't
seen that in at least a week!".

Now think what you'd have done if it was the 1873rd time
you'd gotten that message today.  What you'd say, if I had
to guess, is "sh*t, my gd 'd' key is worn out again.
Anybody got any contact cleaner?"

So you see, sending that message to the local machine
wouldn't help at all.  Instead, they've sent it off to Some
Other Person, chosen at random.  (Well, sort of. The Unix
RAND (3C) function is not, how shall we say, entirely
modern).  The hope is that that other person will take an
action which will cause this particular error message to
Stand Out, and thus be acted upon.  Perhaps, for example,
the person receiving the message will find themself thinking
"gees, you know, I spent 4.3 years writing that paper, and
if it isn't published I will be thoroughly hosed, and now
the copy I sent to Eminent Senior Professor Billy-Jo
Globular at his request has been delivered to "not a
typewriter".  At which point you will FedEx a paper copy to
Dr. Globular, along with a remarkably humble note of
apology, and the honorable Dr. Globular will do the only
possible right thing, which is to trundle off to the
Sendmail Administrator and feed him to a python.

As you may know, lockd is Sun's miserable excuse/bandaid for
a file system that allows two processes to clobber the same

Motorola M88K SVR4 machine.

We have found that any HP can lock a file on any other HP.
The Motorola can lock any file on itself or any HP.  But if
an HP attempts to lock a file on the Motorola, the HP's
lockd server crashes every time.

Since we are calling the lockf function by the book, I
figure the two servers don't speak the same language and
that there must be a log message somewhere.  Fat chance.  So
I read up on lockd and discover the logging option.  So I
restart lockd on the HP with logging.  I then crash the lock
server and look in the log, NO FRIGGING MESSAGE!  (although
it gives me a *truly* useful core dump).  I still don't know

You think this is bad?  Recent queries at my company about
this feature turned up the following helpful advice:

From someone:

    Network file locking is a disaster area. NFS does
    support it; but the code is unbelievably buggy. Sun
    releases jumbo patches monthly.  Other vendors have
    more problems.

    I'd recommend that we have a separate server process,
    deployed optionally, to handle this. If you want
    protection over the net, you have to run our lock
    server.

    NFS file locking over the network is routinely and
    consistently broken. Not just the PC NFS forms, but on
    the workstation products. We should avoid the use of it
    if we possibly can.

From someone else:

    I'd like to second this observation.  At my previous
    company we found that each new release of SunOS seemed
    to break lockf and file locking; we implemented our own
    semaphore system to circumvent the problem.

To write software under Unix is one part writing software
and nine parts battling Unix.

My theory is this: Sun and HP are out in California and for
many years have been infiltrated by radical left wing
ecoterrorists.

Finding and fixing a bug in software requires many hours of
programmer and computer time.  This translates into
thousands of tons of pollutants generated by power plants
that generate the fuel for the computers and the twinkie
factories that generate the fuel for the programmers.

To cut down on the amount of pollution, the radicals are
making Sun and HP recycle on the sly.  The fact that Sun's
lockd can't talk to HP gives it away: this sounds
suspiciously like the old bug with Sun's talk program that
only let it talk to other Sun boxes.  That's right --
they're recycling software bugs.

I suppose it's for the good of the planet.  This may also
provide clues as to why Sun and HP claim to have these
incredibly fast RISC cpu's and yet their computers still
feel like Vax 11/780's on valium.  Maybe it's not just

When NeXT decreed that command line interfaces were out,

                          12/1/92 to 12/24/92

Between now and Christmas purchase any software product from
Aurora Software at 20% off the regular price!  Software
products include:


QuickStart(TM)    Dock extender/application organizer.
                  QuickStart provides the software power
                  user with a convenient window to place
                  software applications in.  Unlike the
                  dock, QuickStart is not limited to only
                  11 applications; you can place an
                  unlimited number of applications in
                  QuickStart.  Furthermore, QuickStart's
                  "Hide on Launch" feature gives QuickStart
                  power to the user without occupying more
                  than a single icon's worth of screen
                  space.  QuickStart is the one piece of
                  software no NeXT computer should be
                  without.

FileStart(TM)     The ultimate file, folder and application 
                  organizer.  Gain instant access to
                  frequently used files, folders and
                  applications by organizing them with
                  FileStart.  Save time and energy by not
                  interrupting your work to look for files
                  or applications.  Simply drag a file,
                  folder or application into FileStart and
                  it will always be conveniently within
                  reach.  Moreover, by strategically
                  grouping related files and folders into
                  projects you can open multiple files with
                  a single double-click of the mouse.  Get
                  organized with FileStart!

Tarre(TM)         Compression & archive utility.
                  Compress and backup your files on a
                  regular basis with Tarre, the easy-to-use
                  compression and archive utility from
                  Aurora Software.  Compress files by as
                  much as 93% by simply dragging them into
                  the Tarre application icon.  Or, backup
                  files and folders into archive files,
                  which can be stored on removable media
                  for safekeeping.  Tarre uses the standard
                  UNIX(TM) programs "tar" and "compress" to
                  read and write archive files that are
                  compatible with virtually every UNIX
                  system.  Gain access to the plethora of
                  free software stored on the ftp archives
                  in tar format!

LoadEye(TM)       System load monitor.
                  LoadEye displays your NeXT's system load
                  in a Load Monitor that you can place
                  anywhere on your screen.  By observing
                  how your actions affect your computer's
                  system load you can learn to use your
                  computer more efficiently and
                  effectively.  For the software developer,
                  LoadEye provides an indication of how
                  much load your application puts on a
                  system, thus allowing you to decide
                  whether further optimizations are
                  necessary.

SuffixRecycler(TM)  Search and recycle.

                    Are you losing disk space to
                    automatically generated backup files?
                    Many applications automatically backup
                    files as they are edited.
                    Unfortunately, a large number of such
                    backup files can dramatically reduce
                    your available disk space.  The
                    solution?  Simply drag a folder into
                    SuffixRecycler, enter the suffix you
                    wish to recycle by
                    (e.g. ".frame.backup" or "~") and click
                    on the recycler button.  All files in
                    the folder that have names ending in
                    the suffix will then be moved to the
                    recycler---automatically.

F__KING LOUSY, NO-GOOD, PIECE OF SHITE SORRY-ASSED EXCUSE
FOR AN OPERATING SYSTEM...

What do you suppose 

csh# rm -rf /tmp/.*

does?

If you said "Csh expands that on the command line and tries
to recursively remove the directory above /tmp (root)", you
were right.

Too bad the shithead who wrote rm couldn't be BOTHERED to
special case obviously bogus commands like "Recursively
remove the directory above me, please".  Undoubtedly,
though, the Unix weenies will maintain that this is the
right thing.

Too bad I decided to swallow my pride and whore myself to
make a little cash on the side by doing UNIX CONSULTING so
now I look like an idiot in front of clients.

Too bad I didn't OWN the Sparc 2 in question so I could
HEAVE IT THROUGH THE PLATE GLASS WINDOW, and watch it
PLUMMET THREE STORIES TO THE CONCRETE SIDEWALK BELOW AND
SMASH INTO A MILLION BILLION TINY PIECES.

There, I feel better now.

Very nice.  Particularly in view of the manual page for rm
which states:

    WARNING
         It is forbidden to remove the file `..' to avoid
         the antisocial consequences of inadvertently doing
         something like `rm -r .*'.

There is no indication that anything overrides this.  What
useful protection!  How nice to have a system which knows
better than I what I really meant to do.

Incidentally, I tried this out for myself just to see if it
worked the same way on my system. This is Unix, and
consistency is not guaranteed.  It did the same thing, but
with one other delightful addition:

    lancet% mkdir foo
    lancet% cd foo
    lancet% mkdir bar
    lancet% cd bar
    lancet% /bin/rm -rf `pwd`/.*
    Segmentation fault
    lancet% 

After all, what Unix feature is complete without the ever
popular Segmentation Fault?

Sorry to clutter up this list but in case it isn't obvious

Subject: Re: Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy...  NOT!!

<sorry, AB.  This is a reply, but it's about a different
obnoxious feature>

Right.  Well if you understood ANYTHING, then you would know
that the correct incantation was:

   ian@reamer> rm -rf /tmp/.??*

But then you find that some wize wizzard has overloaded the meaning of
?, at least here at MIT-AI, so that when you TYPE "rm -rf /tmp/.??*",
you GET:

   tla@reamer> rm -rf /tmp/.
   ../     ./      .X11-unix/   .getwd
   tla@reamer> rm -rf /tmp/.
   ../     ./      .X11-unix/   .getwd
   tla@reamer> rm -rf /tmp/.*

If you don't notice that ? has now been overloaded with
"list possible file name completions", in time to stop
typing and avoid hitting return, then it will do "rm -rf
/tmp/.*" ANYWAY.  After you get screwed with this a few
times you learn that what you should REALLY type is "rm -rf
/tmp/.^V?^V?*".  This is why we should all use Unix(tm)
instead of ITS: unix doesn't require you to type arcane
combinations of control keys to manipulate your files.  You
bash yourself in the head, take a large drink of Ripple and
say "Of course!  A child could figure it out!"  And after
deleting your directory a few times, you get it right.

Of course this won't work if you have files with names like
".x", in which case you have to type "rm -rf /tmp/.[^.]*", I
THINK.  You see there's this problem in unix: there are
REGULAR EXPRESSIONS, which are one thing, and then there are
REGULAR EXPRESSIONS, which are a different thing, and I
sometimes get them confused for some reason, so I'm not sure
whether "/tmp/.[^.]*" is a regular expression or a regular
expression.  They're really very different in appearance,
which is good because they have incompatible semantics.

Pop quiz: identify the types of the following patterns:
  (a) "a*"
  (b) "a*"

(answers: (a) is a regular expression, but (b) is not - it's
a regular expression).

Note the difference in spelling: the patterns used by the
shell are called "regular expressions", whereas the patterns
used by everything else are called "regular expressions."
You should never get them confused.  You see regular
expressions are used for matching in the shell and are
documented in the section "REGULAR EXPRESSIONS", whereas
regular expressions are used for match, a very different
task, in grep(1), and are documented in the section on
"REGULAR EXPRESSIONS".  The former look like strings, but
have special wildcard characters like "?", "*", and "[]",
whereas the latter also look like strings but have special
wildcard characters which look like "?", "*", and "[]".  Be
sure to notice the differences in appearance because they
have different semantics.  For example, the regular
expression "[a-z]*" matches all strings consisting of
lower-case letters, whereas the regular expression "[a-z]*"
matches all files begining with a lower-case letter.

I hope this had made everything clear to everyone.

Subject: Tar And Feathers Vs. Feathers And Tar: Which Works Better?

We long ago resigned ourselves to using Unix, and with it
we've resigned ourselves to its odd syntactic idioms.

We've all long ago resigned ourselves to using TAR to copy
files. It no longer seems a travesty, only a wart.

In the midst of all this resignation, only unix-haters
causes us to stop and wonder, where we would otherwise
merely give up and move on.

I'm pausing to share my wonder with you at this gray hair on

I am so happy that Kerberos has informed me that I have been

write files over the network, thus blowing away the
complicated recursive makefile that I got from somebody else
that I don't really understand.  A novice Unix user would
probably have sent a bug report to the makefile's author,
thus making a fool of himself, but I am an -experienced-

Subject: Yes, C *Does* Rot The Brain


I was looking through a C program - it's a Unix tar file
reader for VMS, nicely implemented by several experienced
programmers over the years - when the following bit of code
struck my eye:

    if (!inbytes && inbytes)
        {
        fprintf( stderr, "tar: unexpected EOF on tar file.\n" );
        perror("tar");
        close( outfd );
        return;
        }

That wonderful "idiom" of C - using integers as "Booleans"
to test for zero/ no-zero!  What a way to hide complete
nonsense as apparently clever code!  Had it been written as:

    if ((inbytes != 0) && (inbytes == 0))

it would have been immediately obvious that something was
wrong.  As it was, I stared at the line for the longest time
trying to understand what strange new idiom the author had
invented.  Bizarre test for inbytes < 0?  But why?  Explicit
test for inbytes == -1?  Again, why?  Despite the fact that
I'm an experienced programmer (hell, when I started FORTRAN
IV was still competing with the older FORTRAN II, which I
learned; I'm no stranger to "idiomatic programming", having
used APL for several years; and I've been using C heavily
for some 13 years - what a horrible thought!) I *still*
ended up writing a little test program to make sure I
understood this expression correctly.

That its "A and not A" appearance doesn't IMMEDIATELY and
obviously condemn it as clearly wrong is just another sign
of how badly C's cavalier use of integers as "Booleans" can
twist the mind.

(Of course, if this had been written in C++, it would have
been:

    if (!inbytes && inbytes)
        {
        stderr << "tar: unexpected EOF on tar file.\n"
        }

or something like that, and the error would have been clear,
right?)

I long ago made it a personal rule to use Boolean operators
only on Boolean variables.  I'm willing to use a language
without all the wonderful safety features, after all, I *am*
a *power programmer*.  But there's no point being a damn
fool about it.

Today I noticed that my mail reader was having trouble

problem.  Normally messages in a sendmail inbox are
separated from each other by lines of the form:

But today, half the messages in my inbox start with lines
that look like:

 The ever-amusing RP wrote the following letter to the editor of

 Dear Rob,

 I was surprised that you disagreed on the headline [in the
 Sept. issue of BYTE magazine] reporting the death of UNIX.

 Not only is UNIX dead, it's starting to smell bad.  If not
 for the advanced state of decomposition, I'd recommend an
 autopsy.  Even without one, though, I can predict what an
 autopsy would have revealed:

 Cancerous pockets throughout; the entire system ravaged by
 malignant growths.

 Opportunistic parasites in all major organs.

 A grossly enlarged liver due to frequent systemic
 poisonings.

 A failed immune system unable to respond to the onslaught.

 Cause of death: a system utterly drained of vitality by
 the constant struggle of fighting the diseases.

 One can only speculate on the mental health of the patient.

[RS and I exchanged a couple of private messages about my
posting of RP's anti-Unix article.  As I was writing this
one, I thought others might find it enlightening as well.]

Nah.  I don't need any stomach medication.  I think things
are looking up.  When even the Unix rags are publishing
things like this, from people like RP, the recognition is
finally coming to everyone that Unix is dying, and quickly.

Unix reminds me of Communism: The original belief that this
was the paradise on Earth; the conviction of inevitability;
the long, dull grinding intermediate years, as the
intellectuals keep finding positive features in something
that those really involved know has none; the recognition
that collapse is inevitable, but the warning that it could
take many, many years.  My prediction is that, as with
Communism, we will see the final sudden total collapse.

One could actually expand this into a nice allegory, with
the two centers of Communism (USSR vs. China) and the two
centers of Unix (BSD vs. System V).  Clearly BSD is like
Maoism, remaining pure through it all, while System V is
Soviet attempts at compromises with reality, doomed to fail
because the core is rotten.  I don't know where exactly OSF
fits in; I suppose it's what we would have gotten if a
government of real left-wing intellectuals and apologists
had gotten into power in the early '70's.  Posix is
Eurocommunism: Keep some of the basic ideas, but compromise
to be accepted by the rest of the world.  It'll die when the
core dies.

Plan 9 and such are the Peruvian Sendoro Luminoso: The
intellectuals build a new movement from pieces of the old
and generate great enthusiasm, at least among some.  But
Sendoro has been crushed, and no one can seriously think
that Plan 9 is going anywhere as a widely-use operating
system.

The great laugh is that, just as Communism has been
supplanted by capitalism, the system it used for all its bad
examples, Unix is going to be supplanted by Windows NT, a
re-done version of the OS Unix weenies hate the most, VMS.

If we were to compare this government to an operating

                   ANNOUNCEMENT OF A LECTURE

About the lecturer:
------------------
Markku Sakkinen is a member of the Department of Computer
Science and Information Systems, University of Jyvaskyla,
Finland.  He has been an active researcher in
object-oriented programming since 1988, with several
published papers in international journals and conference
proceedings. He has been on the programme committees of
ECOOP'91, EastEurOOPe'91, ECOOP'92 and ECOOP'93, and
reviewed papers for other conferences and journals.

Content:
-------
The talk is mostly based on paper [1] augmented by ideas
from [2].  Because of its C heritage, C++ is both weakly
typed and weakly structured.  Because of the basic design
decisions that were made in its object-oriented extensions,
I claim that C++ is also weakly object-oriented.  I will
discuss several aspects and consequences of what I call the
Fundamental Defect: that objects do not carry inambiguous
type information at run time, in contrast to almost all
other OO languages.  The undisciplined handling of pointers
(as in C) makes the problems worse.  I will also mention
some interesting problems of multiple inheritance, mostly
pertaining to the distinction between "virtual" and
"non-virtual" base classes (superclasses).  Several other
features and their problems will be mentioned, such as:
reference types and argument passing, nested classes,
storage classes and garbage collection, overloading,
assignment and copying, templates (genericity) and
exceptions.

The worst disadvantage of C++ at the moment is political:
accepting C++ as the standard OO language de facto tends to
kill other existing languages, and stifle the development of
a new generation of essentially better OO languages.

Ample time will be left for questions and discussion after
the lecture.  That allows us to look at some details that
really interest the audience.  Also, many of my opinions are
controversial, and I do not expect all listeners to accept
them quietly.

You just don't get it, do you?  This is part of PLANNING FOR
THE FUTURE.  Look, suppose your workstation crashed shortly
after you walked away from it.  (Yes, I know, Unix never
crashes - it just runs very slowly, like taking 15 minutes
to respond, now and then.)  If your processes were still in
volatile main memory, they'd be GONE.  But with Sun's
algorithm, they are safely stored away on your non-volatile
hard disk.

You say that when your system reboots (err, I mean, when it
starts running more quickly again) you don't get those
processes back?  Well, that piece of the system hasn't been
finished yet.  But we're working on it; after all, it'll be
written in C, which makes it very easy.  No, wait, we're
doing this one in C++ - you know, the object-oriented
language that makes programming a breeze.  All we need to do
make your process an object and everything will fall out
easily.  Be right back to you....

to mark the page dirty rather than clean after swapping it
it out, which of course made the memory scavenger have the
opposite effect from what was desired.  It was just a bug!
It was not a feature, and it was not what anyone would have
considered acceptable behavior.  Operating systems still

Subject: Why Are Crays Easier To Install Than SCO Boxes?


I love password expiration and overzealous security!  RS had
a really fun time reloading a SCO box here this weekend
because it had expired the root password.  Apparently, it
would have warned me had I not been logged in when it wanted
to expire it.  Apparently, it would have warned me when I
logged out, if the power outage hadn't done that for me.
But no, it just expired me.... thanks SCO!

But, that's not what I am here today to talk to you about, I
am here to talk about the wonderful SCO Unix
installation....  There is something wrong with a UNIX
system that is more difficult to install than UNICOS (the
Cray version of UNIX). Especially on a couple-thousand
dollar 386 box.

Picture this, you have a Dell 386 box sitting in front of
you and an impressive pile of 40+ 3.5" floppies.  You feed
it the first one, which it gladly accepts, displaying its
plumage-like splash screen proudly.  Next, it asks for the
second disk to be loaded.  No sweat, you pop out the N1 disk
and load in the N2 disk and hit return.  The light comes on,
disk whirls, screen clears, text follows...... and then it
stops.  You wait a minute, two, three, get Jolt, and it
still doesn't ask you for another disk... By now you have
noticed that the disk light isn't on and the drive isn't
whirling, so you reboot and try it again.  Needless to say,
the superstitious remedy doesn't work, just more wasted time
goes by.  At about this time, you spy the 1-800 number for
their technical support folks, and decide to give it a
whirl...

Hmmm, an audio response system to "help process your call
more efficiently."  How wonderful, 4 levels of menu later
they tell me they will transfer me to "next available
agent."  I wait about 35 minutes before I finally get a
human being (well, if they didn't want to pay for me to wait
on the phone, they would have either asked me to press 1 to
continue every once in a while or not installed an 800
number, right? :-) ).  Well, the human had no idea why this
system which is listed as working in their compatibility
guide wouldn't even install past the first disk, but they
assured me that if I would stay on hold, they would transfer
me to someone who had a clue.... 25 minutes later I got a
person who asked me what my problem was, had not a clue how
to fix it, but would be glad to get me in touch with
somebody who had a clue.  In order to avoid running out of
stack space, I decided to leave a message instead of
holding.

2 days later I decided they weren't going to call me back,
so I called again... you guessed it, I was on hold.  20
minutes later (at least the wait appeared to decrease over
time), I got passed to somebody who took a message and
promised me that "the person who did the compatibility
testing on that configuration would return my call as soon
as they could so that they could tell me what was wrong with
my hardware configuration."

Well, by the next week, I had had just about enough of this
shite, so I decided to do something really off the wall.  I
called Dell's technical support line.  Since the machine was
over 2.5 years old, the warranty had expired and since I got
SCO from other services, they certainly had no obligation to
answer my questions....so this is what happened:

I dialed their 800 number and got a real human.  She asked
for my serial number, tickled her keyboard for a second and
read off my configuration and address.  They asked what they
could do for me, and I explained that I didn't know if they
could help, but I was having problems installing SCO Unix on
my Dell box.  They passed me off to a UNIX support guy.  I
told the guy my problem, and he informed me that he had done
an install on the same configuration the previous
week... surprised, I answered a number of questions and we
finally found out that the SCO stuff can only load from the
A drive, but I was booting the install disk from the B
drive.  The Dell person walked me through logically changing
my drive ids (not requiring a physical change).

Well, that should be the end of my "I hate SCO, I like Dell"
story, but it isn't.  I had this silly idea that it would be
nice to inform the SCO folks what happened, just in case
they had another customer with the same problem.  That was a
mistake for both of us.  Again, I was on hold for a long
time, and once I got a human again, I got some ridiculous
condescending bullshite about "that can't happen, because
DOS boxes cannot boot off of their B drives."  I asked to
speak to a manager, who then backed up his employee and told
me that he didn't understand why I was calling if I didn't
have a problem any more...

Customer service, the UNIX way.  If it doesn't work, it must
be your fault, and if you paid us to get it to work, you
were stupid!  At least with CTSS I didn't have to pay for
the OS.

Subject: More On Compiler Jibberings...


	C and UNIX (they say) are designed for the
programmer who likes things "terse" and quick.  That's why
the commands are 2 or 3 character names like "ls" and
"awk".  That's all fine with me, but what really boggles my
mind a little bit is the C compiler/environment.

	Nowadays we have ANSI C, which is intended to solve
some of the problems with C.  Well, one of the big problems
with C that ANSI C "solves" is function parameter call
mismatches.  It *FORCES* you to pre-declare functions and
their parameters before you use them, and it checks to make
sure that you're handing it the right thing if you invoke
it.  Well, actually, it will accept any random joe bob data
if you use this wonderful thing called a "cast" which lets
you tell the compiler, "sure that string is really an IEEE
floating point number.  go use it.  don't bother to try to
convert it to anything first."  But casts aren't what we're
here to talk about today, - we're here to talk about
function prototyping and how it is good for you.

	It's surprising, really, that C, a language
developed in the heady, terse UNIX environment would
incorporate something like function prototypes.  It's a lot
of extra typing.  Worse, it makes the programmer do extra
work to generate reasonably correct code.* I've always been
amazed that the scrotty-bearded UNIX gurus out on the net
haven't done everything they could to kill this awful waste
of keystrokes.  Think of the bandwidth savings in usenet
source postings alone, if function prototypes were removed!

	Of course the most amazing thing about function
prototypes that everyone overlooks is that a DECENT
environment, with a decent compiler and linker, would be
able to check all that stuff at link time!  There's nothing
wrong with C as it was originally designed, it's just that
nobody thought to have link-type parameter checking built
into the compilation environment.  Rather than someone
putting all that work into the linker (what, a few months?)
we have a language standard that forces every user to
perform the job of link editor in their head.  Great.  And
it's becoming the lingua franca of programming in the 90s.
It's grimly amusing to note that UNIX, the cradle of C as it
were, lags hopelessly behind DOS in the quality of C
programming environments, with the notable exception of
Saber-C.  Saber-C is another unusual case, however, since it
gives you a NICE environment, with compile and link error
checking, runtime error checking, and so on, and when you
want to actually generate an executable....?  You're on your
own and you're back to using the outdated piece of shit
compiler the vendor gives you with your system - a
descendant of the original 'pcc' or some similar
abomination, hacked on by generations of grad students on
their way to guruhood.  Or you can use gcc, if you have the
time, the MIPS, and the disk space, and can tolerate its
little foibles.

	The crowning glory of it all is C++, the birthplace
of function prototypes.  Function prototypes must have been
implemented the way they were because it was easier for the
compiler writer to get all the parameters before starting to
parse the function, rather than having to figure them out in
the ensuing lines.  When a language is bent, twisted, and
malformed to save the compiler writer a bit of effort,
you've got to wonder why the guy's writing compilers in the
first place.  Now, C++ could really use a decent compilation
environment, with link time name resolution.  But
NnnnnoooooOOOOOOO, rather than "do it right" some late night
caffeine and taco fever nightmare scheme was concocted
whereby symbols get transformed into DES-encrypted dog vomit
and back.

	C++ is heading for standardization. All of this
happened because nobody wanted to put a few hooks for type
checking in their linker and object file format. I think
there's a lesson in all this, but I'm damned if I can see
it.



*The story of the programmer who wrote all his function
prototypes to accept (char *) and cast everything to (char
*) before calling any function is pure fiction. Really.

bullshite.

Since when is it acceptable for a language to incorporate
two entirely diverse concepts such as setf and cadr into the
same operator (=), the sole semantic distinction being that
if you mean cadr and not setf, you have to bracket your
variable with the characters that are used to represent
swearing in cartoons?  Or do you have to do that if you mean
setf, not cadr?  Sigh.

Wouldn't hurt to have an error handling hook, real memory
allocation (and garbage collection) routines, real data
types with machine independent sizes (and string data types
that don't barf if you have a NUL in them), reasonable
equality testing for all types of variables without having
to call some heinous library routine like strncmp,
and... and... and...  Sheesh.

I've always loved the "elevator controller" paradigm,
because C is well suited to programming embedded controllers
and not much else.  Not that I'd knowingly risk my life in
an elevator that was controlled by a program written in C,
mind you...

	1: 'A' is nauseating (and you give reasons)
	2: anything worse than 'A' is surely unthinkable
	3: -but- 'B' is, in fact, worse than 'A'

Generally when slamming C++ all you need to do is find
something C does badly, point and jeer and say, "lookit how
DUMB that is good golly!"  and then pause, ask the audience,
"can you imagine something worse?" and while they're all

you point out that C++ in fact *DOES* something worse!!

Gets 'em every time.


Let's do the exercise:

	C's notion of how data objects are stored to disk is
pretty primitive.  This can be excused to a degree because C
wasn't *designed* to solve that problem, it's a lower-level
language.  However, it's clear that any reasonable
higher-level language needs to support some kind of not
entirely brain-crippled persistent storage.

	C++ is designed as an "object oriented programming
language" but, if you look at how object persistence can be
done.....  uh....  It *CAN* be done, right?  You mean you
need to write some kludgy stuff that does a C-style write()
and assigns a type flag and then does a *cast* or something
down in its guts??  And if you cast an object to another
type of object it forgets what it is?  Waitamminit!!!!  You
mean every application that wants to do persistence has to
kludge its own application-specific tricks together to make
it work?

	Yes. C++. At better compiler stores near you.

Subject: Another Day, Another Lost File

No, this isn't a story about the Fast File System or the
Journalled Fast File System or the Network File System
crashing on me and turning /dev/sd0fmh259 into cottage
cheese; this is a story about ordinary shell commands, and
the ways of typing "yes" and "no".  [Hint: it isn't about
calls to "(clear-input *query-io*)", which is something
every implementation of yes-or-no-p I've written would
contain.]

For about a week I've had an Emacs running on my machine
logged-in as "hqm".  The reason, or course, is that I
started doing some trivial bug-fixes for some problems he
was having from his machine, which bloomed into a full-scale
system major-version upgrade which touched most files in the
system, which meant that our terminally sophisticated
version-control system ended up with most system source
files "locked" by him.  

Now eventually I got somewhat tired of this situation, and
tried to find a way to be myself again.  Now of course I was
unable to find any way to do this (staring at man pages for
tens of minutes leads to a particular feeling of frustration
combined with rage -- and RCS is one of the better, more
robust, better documented systems out there.)  But then I
realised that Unix has a Wonderful Feature, quite unlike all
those Proprietary, Closed, Non-Object-Centric systems out
there: all its files are just big, steaming heaps of bytes,
so I could directly edit the version-control files (whose
format I did not and do not understand) to directly effect
the change I wished to make.  I was emboldened to pursue
this course of action by the fact that "hqm" and "mly" both
have three letters, and I couldn't see anything which looked
like a checksum anywhere.  Well, believe it or not, this
actually worked!  

Well, for a while I thought that it might not have worked,
because I kept getting an error about "RCS file foo.c is in
use" (an error-message to which no reference could be found
in any manual, and on which commands like "rcs -unlock
-force -gd" had no effect but to cause it to be repeated)
but it turns out that this is just normal, regular unix
brain-death, caused by a machine having crashed in the
middle of a source-control transactional critical section.
RNMWO anybody?  BTW it only took me about half a day to
regain control of my files.  Hey, another technique (which
just occurred to me) would have been to "check-in" all the
partially-broken development files and then check them all
out as myself, and them somehow try to back the public
sources back out to the previous, consistent state.  I guess
I could have used some keyboard-macro wonderment to make
that happen.  It might have only taken three or four hours.

But I didn't come here to talk about missing RCS features or
filesystems designed by subhumans, I came to talk about my
pals "mv" "chown" and "cp".

But before I do that, I should tell you about my adventures
trying to actually be "hqm" for a week so that I could attempt
to continue the hacking I'd started, before I decided to engage
in the adventure of wresting control of the sacred sources from
him.  I do the normal unix thing of "su"-ing to the super-user
and then "su"-ing to "hqm" (so much easier and more secure than
asking him for his password, I find.)  So now I was typing at a
terminal emulator with Henry's shell prompt and Henry's
environment all set up and I started Emacs which loaded Henry's
initialisation file and I attempt to mess with a file and RCS
tells me that I can't because the file is already checked-out by
"hqm".  

Well, "Who am I if not hqm?", I wonder.  Fortunately, unix
provides me with a Special Purpose Tool for answering just
this very question: I type "whoami" to a shell and I'm told
"hqm".  (Little known Fun Unix Fact: "who am i" will also
tell you; unfortunately "what rough beast" only manages
"can't open rough (26) / can't open beast (26)" which
somehow lacks the cadence of TS WHAT's reply.)  So I'm "hqm"
but I can't edit files because hqm has them locked.  Well,
you long-time sufferers know what's coming next: it turns
out that although I'm "hqm" I'm not -really- "hqm" ("quick:
is this a regular expression or a regular expression...")
but actually somebody pretending to be "root" pretending to
be "hqm".  Oh crafty Unix, to have seen through the veils of
my deception!  (Incidentally, I asked "who am i really" but
was told nothing of any use.)  So to be truly one with Henry
I must telnet to my own machine and log in as him, and then
Emacs.

But I didn't come here to talk about "su" and "who ?am ?i"
(aka "who*am*i"), I want to tell you about what happened as
the result of being Henry (not just -pretending- to be Henry
in such a way that everything but RCS appeared to work, mind
you, but really, truly being actual hqm) and the files "he"
wrote into my home directory.

At this point I could tell you about the fact that there are
really two hqm's with different user-ids, and how the former
one works with AFS and the latter doesn't and how the System
Administration Cretins at PARC turned off mail forwarding
from the former to the latter as a service to their user
community, but this isn't the place for that.

So, I have these two files sitting in my directory named
"oxds-trace" and "nxds-trace" and I need to perform a really
hairy comparison upon them.  The reason the comparison is
complicated is that these two files contain voluminous
dumpings of the internal state of an interpreter engine (I'm
trying to find what I've done to make it no longer work) and
of course about the only thing you can print in a typical C
program is the hexadecimal address of objects in memory,
which of course changed wildly when I relinked the program.
I spend a couple of hours writing a medium-hairy Emacs
function which compares two buffers, globally changing any
"0xdeadbeef"-type string at which a mismatch occurs into the
same "#:G00259" identity-preserving token in both buffers so
that I can look for actual changes in the actual objects
being dealt with rather than for changes in the whims of the
virtual-address-assigner.

Now these two files are owned by "hqm" (remember him? --
he'd being doing development on my machine using my keyboard
and my hands for the last week, because I unable to bring
myself to do the foul RCS deed to which I eventually
resorted) and Emacs gets all stroppy about doing auto-saves
and about overwriting those files because I'm ("mly") not
"hqm" and I really shouldn't be pissing on his files (be
they written in a directory owned by "mly" or not.)

Eventually I get Sufficiently Sick of Emacs' complaints that
I do a stupid thing: rather than patch the emacs-lisp code
not to complain, I decide to fix the ownership of the files
so that they're really mine-all-mine.  (At this point, one
may hear calls from the peanut gallery, cries of "Oh NOOO!
Don't do THAT!!")


Let's follow my little adventure in full shell-o-rama:

   anonymous> ls -la *tr
   -rw-r--r--  1 hqm       1228179 Jan 15 18:07 nxds-tr
   -rw-r--r--  1 hqm       2814780 Jan 15 18:20 oxds-tr

First, I try to make the files writable by myself

   anonymous>chmod u+wx nxds-tr oxds-tr
   chmod: nxds-tr: Not owner
   chmod: oxds-tr: Not owner

OK.  That doesn't work.  I'll try to make them owned by
myself.

   anonymous>chown mly nxds-tr oxds-tr
   chown: nxds-tr: Not owner
   chown: oxds-tr: Not owner

I'm not allowed to do that?  Perhaps I should try a bigger
hammer (actually, the -only- hammer -- the world looks like
one really big nail from here in unix-land)

   anonymous>su
   Password:
   anonymous# chown mly nxds-tr oxds-tr
   chown: nxds-tr: Not owner
   chown: oxds-tr: Not owner
   anonymous# whomai
   root
   
Hmmm.  Even though I'm all-powerful, I'm not powerful enough
to do a simple operation.  (That's part of "NFS Not
Preserving [sacred] Unix Filesystem Sematics", and that's
another story.)  But that's OK, I'm powerful enough to
become somebody less powerful who has power over the files.

   anonymous# su hqm

"su hqm"?  You'd think that I'd have learned that there's
"hqm" and then there's "hqm", but, golly gee, I don't seem
to have learned, do I?

Let's try again!

   anonymous% whoami
   hqm
   anonymous% chown mly nxds-tr oxds-tr
   Must be root to use chown

Ahhh...  but I just -was- "root"... (and I was told that I
wasn't the owner.)

If I'd learned my lesson, and if I could remember what hqm's
password was, at this point I'd have telnetted to my own
machine and tried again, but I hadn't or I didn't want to or
I was tired of the whole mess.

   anonymous% ls -la *tr
   -rw-r--r--  1 hqm       1228179 Jan 15 18:07 nxds-tr
   -rw-r--r--  1 hqm       2814780 Jan 15 18:20 oxds-tr

Well, at least the files are still there!

   anonymous% exit
   anonymous% anonymous# exit
   anonymous# anonymous>whoami
   mly

Back to mehood!  I decided that the simplest thing to do is
to just copy the contents of the files (after all, I can
read them) to new files and just delete the old ones.  ("Oh
NOOO!  Don't do THAT!!")  Now those who all just called out
"Oh NOOO!  Don't do THAT!!" think that I'm about to type
something like "cp nxds-tr nxds-tr" or "cat nxds-tr >
nxds-tr" but I'm no unix neophyte -- I know about this
aspect of Unix Filesystem Semantics and know that NFS is
specially designed to NFS to Preserve that Semantic!!  So I
rename the file first, before copying it.

For good measure, I decide to also copy the file to /tmp/,
in case my Emacs-lisp function runs amok and eats it all up.

   anonymous>mv nxds-tr damn
   anonymous>cp damn nxds-tr
   anonymous>cp nxds-tr /tmp/o

These files are big, so rather than sitting around waiting
for the first copies to complete, I type-ahead commands to
copy "oxds-tr"; in fact, I use the same commands I used
above.  ("Oh NOOO!  Don't do THAT!!")

   mv oxds-tr damn
   cp damn oxds-tr
   cp damn /tmp/o
   anonymous>mv: replace `damn', overriding mode 0644? anonymous>
   anonymous> anonymous>

Can you guess what happened to "oxds-trace"?

PS An even more useful unix command than "who am i" is
"yes".

Such a sad story of unix lossage.  I was screaming OH NOOO!
Don't DO THAT!  right along with your comments.  A few
months ago I learned the "don't use type-ahead" lesson:

I had this 50 megabyte host table I had just spent a week
gathering up from all corners of the world.  I had to
process it a bit, munging out all the bogons and such.
Thing like:

  nobogons < hosts > foo
  mv foo hosts

I decided to try out the special feature of unix that
actually lets you type two commands on just one line.  So
the next commands I did were:

  sort < hosts > foo;  mv foo hosts

I guess unix was never meant for repeatedly processing the
same file and creating new versions of it.  On Tops-20 I
woulda just outputted the result to the next generation of
the same file.

Of course, sort died because /tmp filled up with temporary
sort garbage.  But before it died, it wrote out a few
megabytes into foo, thinking that I might be happy with at
least a partial sort.

But on *my* version of unix, mv doesn't ask you the nice
question about overiding an 0644.  It just goes and does it.
For some reason, I thought that because I typed two commands
on the same line, the second wouldn't happen if the first
died.

Oh well, who needs a 50 megabyte host table anyways.

Dump's tape calculations are arcane and completely obsolete.
You just have to fake it out, and experiment with the
numbers until you get something you like.

Dump always does the length calculation, to pipes or
anyplace else.

The right fix is for dump to notice when it gets EOF writing
to the tape, and change tapes at that point.  That would be

It has just dawned on me that Unix is eventually going to
drive me stark raving bonkers crazy.  I am -not-
exaggerating -- I truly believe that the only possible
outcome of my having to use this piece of shite environment
for a few more years is a padded cell.  I mean how many
times do I have to suffer throught the same set of bugs
screwing me over in the same old way with no end in sight?
Tonight, in the course of just trying to get some gd work
done I discovered that if I use DEC's telnet program to
connect to Sun's telnet server, then I'm not allowed to type
^S, ^Q or ^O.  I thought we stomped out all forms of this
lossage ten years ago.

All I want to do is search through a file for a particular
string -- and I'd like to use Gnu emacs -- but I can't type
^S can I?  So now I am totally pissed off at the way Unix
and the total clown programmers it creates can make any
simple task into a trip through frustration hell.  Something
that I could have accomplished in 5 minutes takes half an
hour (longer if I take time out to send a flame to
Unix-Haters) and raises my blood pressure in the process.

How hard can it be to write a telnet program that just gets
out of your way and lets a remote computer talk to your
terminal?  We're not talking SUPDUP here (a wonderful
protocol that actually -did- -something- -useful-) but its
cousin TELNET -- the village idiot of remote terminal
protocols.  Think about it: this telnet program has to
actually make a -special- -effort- to get in my way like
this!  Some Bozo probably spent days designing this
particular misfeature.  He probably worked late nights
trying hard to get it -just- -right-.  What a worthless
little weenie.

Of course the Meta key doesn't work either, but it never
works no matter -where- I telnet too, so I've learned not to
expect it, but this ^S/^Q/^O lossage only happens when
telnetting to a Sun, so it always comes as a painful
surprise.

I have this NeXT machine at home.  As far as Unix boxes go,
it doesn't suck.  In fact, it's not too bad since NeXT
decided to bag standards and go for useability.  Hell, they
even bagged that motherhood concept of user configurability
so that all next machines would have a consistent interface.
("You may only use the state-mandated key and mouse

For some reason, the disk goes crazy at 2am every night.  It
turns out there is this find command that looks through the
entire file system for files named .nfs* and deletes them.
No trial.  Instant death.  And never mind that I don't run
nfs, or even a network for that matter.  You never know
where these things can pop up.

So I got a nifty new cd-rom drive.  It lets me keep 600MB of
information online.  Some say it's the biggest happening
since the Gutenberg press.  Anyhow, here it is 2:28 am and
the cd-rom is cranking away.

Yep, find is looking for those pesky .nfs bogons on my
cd-rom so it can try and delete them.  Sort of like a dog
chasing a car; you wonder what it will do if it catches it.

Anyhow, you would think the person that wrote this would
have used a little more common sense.  After all, the
/etc/mtab clearly says the cd-rom is mounted read-only.  I
mean what could be clearer than the old /etc/mtab file:

/private/vm/swapfile "/private/vm/swapfile.front" swapfs rw 1 2
/dev/sd0a "/" 4.3 rw,noquota,noauto 0 1
/dev/rsd1h "/BSD386_GAMMA4" cfs ro,removable,filesystem=CDROM 1 2

See that "ro"?  That means "read-only".  I think.  And those
numbers must mean something really important.

That's what I like about unix.  All the crucial information

from the serial port.  What to do when you're scrolling and
a character comes in?  Why send a ^S down the line, of
course!  And if the silly user has set the "Don't send
^S/^Q" bit?  Why, just throw away the characters until
you're done scrolling and put in a backwards question mark
instead.  AUGH!  What pieces of shite!  And the next worse
thing is that everyone else decided that this was OK
behavior and decided to emulate it when they built their own
"smart" terminals.

There are a number of contribution factors as to why AB is
seeing this behavior.

1. Is that it has been only recently that the Telnet RFC has
been amended to allow the local system to do flow control
and process special characters locally.

2. Most lusers are still mentally dependant on printing
terminals, exhibited by personal computer communication
programs and window system terminal emulators such as xterm
and sun-cmd windows in sunstools that emulate a
near-infinite roll of paper.

3. In order to compensate for faster and faster computers
and their networks buffering up larger amount of output for
people to read, many Telnet implementations process "common"
characters, as everyone uses them in the same manner and
merely sends various embedded commands to the remote Telnet
server.  After all, if you type ^S, you really do mean to
stop output on your local terminal, not actually have it
mean a command of some sort to the remote system, no?

The latter is on a par with the GNU community's bigotry in
calling ^H a help character in emacs and forcing you to use
^U as a line erase character in gdb/bash, all regardless of
what your terminal editing characters are set to before you
enter the program.

Subject: Unix-Haters Was Right All Along.


Naturally, emergencies always materialize themselves in the
days just before you have scheduled a vacation.  Late on the
day before I was about to leave, I wanted to do one more run
of a benchmark experiment that takes about half an hour to
run.  So I start this thing up, and come back after about a
half an hour with a colleague so we can see what the results
are.  What do we see?  "Segmentation violation".  Oh,
thanks.  I've been running this program all day, and have
only made one slight change to it, and the program bombs,
telling me nothing useful, after half an hour.  This is a
client-server situation, so I have to tie up two machines
for a half an hour each time.

So I decide to try to figure out what's wrong.  Now, if I
had been paying attention to Unix-Haters the way I ought to,
I would have known all along that this was Futile and
reflected a Bad Attitude.  But I went ahead as if I were
using a real computer.  I ran the program under gdb.  After
the half-hour wait, gdb says (I can't remember the precise
words of this message but I've seen it before) "Illegal
memory reference.  Inferior process no longer exists."
I.e., no useful information whatsoever.

I try once more.  I run under gdb, and periodically
interrupt the program, so I can at least get a lower bound
on where the problem is.  I do this for a while.  Then it
stops responding to my control-C's.  I soon discover that
it's not responding to anything, in any window.  Soon after
that I find that none of the workstations all the way down
the hall are responding to anything!  Everyone's trying to
figure out what's going on.  The most usual suspects are the
servers, but they're all up.  We quickly determine that the
Ethernet is saturated.  Someone with a PC (when you want to
do a real job, you don't turn to Unix) analyzes the packets:
lo and behold there is a swarm of UDP packets between my two
machines.  Now everyone's telling everyone else "Oh, this is
all Dan's fault!"

The theory quickly arrived at was that one of the machine is
doing a core dump onto a directory NFS-mounted onto the
other machine.  There's no way to tell, of course, since
everything is totally wedged.  At this point I had had
enough.  I just powered down one of my machines.  Everyone
else's machine duly resumed its wretched Unix existence.
The kind thing to do would be to leave that machine powered
down, and maybe power down some more.  Unixthenasia.

All along Unix-Haters has been telling me that if I try to
make things Better, I will just be Punished.  I fully expect
that if I try once more to find this problem, Unix will find
a way to wipe every hard disk owned by the company, and then
we'll learn all about bugs in the tape backup software that
caused all our tapes to contain nothing but a zillion copies
of the root's .login file.  Unix-Haters was right all along.

It's worse than that, they're aspiring to be IBM
clone-makers.

Observe the completely useless keys marked "scroll lock",
"print screen", and "F12".  And this is the so-called "unix
keyboard" which we eventually persuaded them to send us to
replace what's laughingly referred to as the "UK keyboard".
What are the keys that look as if they should be on a TV
remote control?  Maybe they do something under "open"
windows, but I've no plans to ever find out.  My Sun
keyboard has 119 keys, of which I use less than half.  I was
tempted to saw off everything to the left [right?] of the
return key, but instead I've mapped all 34 of them to
delete.

Soon they'll be be providing miniature screens with some
absurdly low resolution - oh, they already do that.  Maybe
they should get rid of Sparcs and use those nice Intel
processors instead.

Sun-2s had nice keyboards.  Every one Sun has made since
then has been worse than the one before.

	This is what's wrong with UNIX and this is one
reason why UNIX has sucked for 20 years and resolutely
continues to suck. There are people out there (like this
guy) who TRULY BELIEVE that an appropriate response to
buying software that's buggier than a manhattan flophouse is
to FIX IT HIMSELF rather than to insist that the vendor fix
it!!

	Note how the patient lists "complain to the vendor"
as the final resort. This is because with UNIX vendors and
THE OPEN SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY it is WRONG to sell something
BUG FREE.  Something that actually WORKS IS PROPRIETARY and
therefore it is BAD!

	UNIX is a "do it yourself" operating system because
the folks who sell it generally have little to no experience
in creating robust commercial quality environments. This is
what happens when ex college hackers and computer scientists
become managers of vendor software departments.  As much as
most reasonable people hate Microsoft Windows it has the big
advantage that IF SOMETHING IS BROKEN YOU CAN'T FIX IT!
That means that customers call and BITCH and COMPLAIN.  With
UNIX if you call a vendor and say "my oi command is
broken"(*) They usually start a dialog that goes like this:

	Customer: I run "oi -c -f -q /dev/fratz -t -m=5" and
I get a segmentation fault. Can I get a working version of
your piece of shite operating system, please?
	Support: Hmmm.... That's a pretty serious
problem. We're aware of that - it's SPR#2322, filed in 1985
- we'll have it fixed in the next release.
	Customer: HEY! But I need it to work NOW! And I have
a software service contract [rustles papers at telephone]
that says you guys provide bug fixes. I want a version of
"oi(1)" with the working "-q /dev/fratz" option!!
	Support: [thinks] Do you have GNUemacs installed on
your system?
	Customer: Huh? Yeah, why?
	Support: Darn. Sorry. I hate to tell you this but
the minute you installed unqualified third party software,
you voided your software warranty. Your system is now in an
"UNSUPPORTED CONFIGURATION" which means we can't even give
you the time of day unless you present a letter from The
Pope.
	Customer: AUuuGHHGHGHGHH!!! BUT - BUT!!! But what
about "Open Systems"!!!?!?!?  I'll take my business to your
competitors!
	Support: No problem, but I think it's only fair to
inform you that most UNIX vendors now have a clause in the
support contracts that if you've ever even TOUCHED another
vendor's system, that your BRAIN is in an "UNSUPPORTED
CONFIGURATION" and they'll tell you to call us.
	Customer: *whimper* - but - I gotta have my UNIX....
	Support: Well, since you're already in an
"UNSUPPORTED CONFIGURATION" maybe you can grab the GNUoi
sources off the net and build a version that works? Great
idea, huh?
	Customer: [enthusiastic] Yeah! I'll do that! Gosh! I
can fix things myself when they're broken! Isn't UNIX
GREAT!?!  [Hangs up the phone]

	That's the first sign of advanced UNIXitis. The next
one is that the victim wants X-Windows running on everything
in sight, but X-Windows syndrome, its symptoms, and cure
(napalm) are the topic of another discussion.


"oi(1)" is a nonexistent UNIX command with a 2-letter name used
for this example because the 2-letter name was terse and saved
me a keystroke, which I then wasted many times over for this
explanation.

Since "delete" interrupts the process (which then

Back at Terrapin we wanted a Sun 2, but they had a 90-day
lead time, so we bought a QBUS based 68010 Unix system with
a Quantum reel tape drive.  Its main advantage, besides
being the only other systerm with virtual memory, was that
we could just buy RS232 boards and such at Eli's, because it
was QBUS.

Anyway, dump never quite worked right.  It would dump for
about half an hour, then get an EOT error, and then we'd
have to reboot the machine to make it work again.
Eventually, the Company (hopefully long since deceased) told
us to use the "-s " argument to tell the tape drive that the
tape was shorter than 2400 feet.  This pretty much fixed
things, unless we forgot and had to boot the machine.

Next, we noticed our Vadic 1200 baud modem wasn't working
right.  If we fiddled with the switches and made it accept
up to 1215 baud, it started working.  Come to think of it,
we'd always had trouble with the clock being wrong.

Well folks, we complained of these problems to the Company,
and they fixed things by sending us a new CPU with a
slightly slower clock speed.

Ever notice how most unices, the ones that don't use MMDF,
often send you half-complete messages? Ever wonder where all
those lost bits GO??

But the point of this is that it really hasn't got much to
do with MMDF, it has to do with unix itself. The problem,
see, is that the machine you mention, MC, is only a poor
little Microvax 3, with probably only 16Mb of memory. Which,
you would think, would be perfectly adequate to run a mailer
and a filesystem.  And it would have been, too, except that
the nice helpful people who brought you unix invented this
thing called the "fork", which they then proceeded to stick
- um, sorry, about to get a little carried away, there.

But anyway, see, by employing the great unix principle of
"composable functionality", they were able to determine that
even though 99.9997 percent of the time you create a new
process you are -going to use it to run a new program-, it
would be a Good Thing to separate the notion of creating a
new process from the notion of stuffing the new program you
wanted to run into its address space.

Now, if you were going to do that, you might at least think
that you could arrange some kludge to optimize the common
case.(1) But no, that would be -messy-, and unix is not
-messy-. So, kids, the way we run a program here is to use
is the "fork" system call, which takes a running program,
makes a new process, and -copies (and I mean -copies-, as in
moves bits around on the disk), the entire address space of
the old program into the new one-, followed, 99.9997 percent
of the time, by the "exec" system call, which takes the
newly copied bits and -instantaneously throws them all
away-.

And that's why MMDF is slow.

(1) And you bloody well could, too, if you were from
California.  Just forget about that for now, OK?

Danny Bobrow, Ron Kaplan, Larry Masinter (all at PARC),
Richard Burton, Peter Deutsch and Warren Teitelman (all
ex-PARC) are to be awarded that ACM's Computer and
Information Processing Software System Award. Why? For the
development of Interlisp, and its facilities such as
integrated compiler and interpreter, source level debugging,
structure editing, graphical user interface integration,
automatic change management and analysis and profiling
tools. The generic description of the award describes how
the recipients will have had a lasting influence on the
development of software systems.

I wish.  Now I write programs in C and C++ (ok, sometimes
Lisp when I'm lucky) using emacs on a window system set up
to look like ten hardcopy terminals at once.  Since the
address space is rudely split, non-intrustive profiling
tools are just impossible, but fortunately we don't have the
integration in the environment to make them work anyway.  I
do storage management by hand.  I am aware of the difference
betwen -O2 and -O4 because Sun (and no-one else) can write a
compiler which optimises properly.  I put printfs in my code
in order to trace it.  The closest I can come to an
all-purpose User Interface Management Systems is emacs.

What is the lasting influence of Interlisp?  It is that,
almost twenty years since it was developed...  and even
though the current implementation is still a byte-code
emulator for the Dorado's instruction set...  still, after
all this, I bloody wish I was still using it.

It's only impossible if you're a UNIX kernel, and don't have
the brains to realize that once namei() has resolved the
name to an inode, you're done looking in the directory and
can thus remove it without actually sawing off the branch
you're standing on.

The UNIX philosophy is to prevent you from shooting yourself
in the foot, but only if the gun is unloaded.

Subject: Out Of Disk Space, So I Zeroed Your File...

   From: DW
   Date: Sat, 3 Apr 93 13:52:55 EST
   To: ..., system-hackers@one.two.thr, ...
   I've temporarily fixed the problem on all of the servers
   except for random1.  The .envrc file was modified
   yesterday, to change how the path was set....
[ Explanation omitted. ]
   *** I have totally screwed up random1. *** There's no
   space left on the disk, so when I tried to write to
   .envrc it got zeroed out.  If anyone knows why it's out
   of disk space, please feel free to do the right thing.

You might think that on the operating system favored by
academic computer scientists there would be a reasonable
mechanism in place to update files as an atomic operation.

Some of you may be lucky enough to recall that ITS had the
RENMWO (rename while open) system call, which most programs
actually used.  The idea was fairly simple, when a program
(say TECO) wanted to write a file, it opened an output
channel to a file with a funny name like "AB;_TECO_
OUTPUT".  Then it wrote out the proposed new file contents
to that file.  After it was satisfied that the contents were
correct, the program used RENMWO to rename the still open
file to the correct final name, say "AB;UNIX HATERS",
simultaneously deleting any old file with that name.  If
something went wrong -- the system ran out of disk space, or
the program crashed, or ITS itself crashed -- the worst that
would happen is that the user might find a file named
"_TECO_ OUTPUT" on his or her directory.  Simple, safe.

Most users were dimly aware of this mechanism, at least in
as much as they would occasionally have to delete a file
with a funny name from their directory.  And let me
emphasize that this was a fairly common occurrence.  On any
given day, poking around the file system, you could almost
always count on finding one or two of these files.  Each one
evidence that something had gone wrong, but that use of
RENMWO had saved the user from corrupting any previous
version of the file.

But what do we do on Unix?  Well, first we open the file for
output using the O_TRUNC flag, which means that the old bits
are gone for good before we even begin to write out the new
ones.  No disk space?  Program bug?  Operating system crash?
Tough luck.  (Sure, there are things that a Unix program
-can- do along the lines of RENMWO.  Perhaps even use the
rename(2) system call.  But a zillion little things make
this incredibly inconvenient in practice.  Like, suppose the
user doesn't have write access in the containing directory?
Or suppose we want to preserve the original owner of the
file?)

So the question arises, if this situation happened once or
twice a day on a typical ITS machine, where a safety
mechanism prevented it from doing any damage, why doesn't
the lack of such a safety measure screw Unix users all the
time?

Well, part of the answer is that is -does- screw Unix users,
at least occasionally.  Witness DW's message above.  I've
been bitten too.  (I once zeroed out the password file on a
machine I was using this way, and boy did I think carefully
about what to do next in that situation!)

But it probably doesn't happen as much as our experience
with ITS suggests it should for a couple of reasons.  First,
we have a lot more disk space here in the future.  Running
out of disk space on the file system containing ones
personal files used to happen every couple of weeks, now
that is a somewhat more rare, although not unknown,
phenomenon.  Secondly, we have hardware that is quite
reliable compared to what we used to have.  Crashing in the
middle of something critical is simply a lot less likely.

So I would conclude from this that Unix is able to get away
with being sloppy about this issue because technology (in
the form of bigger disks and more reliable hardware) has
helped to -hide- Unix's deficiencies.  As the technology
continues to improve, we can look forward to even -lower-
standards of software engineering in our operating systems.

Emacs has also helped hide this problem.  I have many times

Another reason: many of us use GNU Emacs, which normally
uses the Unix analogue of RNMWHO (although it has options to
write directly to the original file, if you want to preserve
ownership, etc.).  Of course, that's because it was written
by a former ITS hacker.

At our site, we frequently run out of disk space in our
/usr/local partition.  And the "install" command on SunOS
doesn't report write errors!

Ah, the sweet rush of relief at the return to the
unix-haters fold.  Thank you thank you.  Here's my initial
flame I sent to unix-haters-request, may you all take from
it what little enjoyment you can as you fight the good
battle against the big evil.

--------

   This is a request to be readmitted to the vaunted halls
   of unix-haters, which list I fell off as a side effect
   of being laid off from CompCo.  I thought I'd wait to
   make this request until I had something to say.  Thank
   you for your consideration.

   So, here I am in my lisp window, typing forms, doing my
   thing, being happy it's lisp and not C (but mad that
   it's the foreign function interface to C, but we won't
   go into that here).  So I type (load "myfile").  It
   takes a while to do all the stuff that's in myfile, so I
   trundle off to another window to do some other work.
   While doing so, I realize there's an addition I could
   make to myfile to make my life easier in the future, and
   not thinking about it, I just add the form to the middle
   of myfile and save out the file, and go back to my
   secondary task.  Eventually I decide to check on the
   loading process.

   There it is, in living color:

   Error: the variable OBAR is unbound.
     1 (continue) Try evaluating it again

   What the hell???  I didn't make any variable like that.
   So I look for OBAR...  Aha!  Near the end of myfile,
   approximately the number of characters I had added from
   the end, is (load "foobar")

   Yep, I had changed myfile, and the existing process that
   was reading it got the changes to its open file!  My
   addition was to the middle of the file, but did that
   stop it from losing?  No, it just blindly went ahead and
   found more data in the file and gave it to me, never you
   mind that it *wasn't* appended to!

   Gaaa!  VERSION NUMBERS you idiots, VERSION NUMBERS.
   Gaaa!  Or at the very least, DON'T GIVE ME NEW DATA THAT
   I DON'T WANT!

Subject: Environments -- Why Should I Care?

Months ago there was a message on this list about how Unix
is the only operating system that requires you to recompile
programs to install them.  Or something like that (it's all
so terrible that I try to repress it).

But it's worse than that: Unix is the only operating system
that *requires* users to do system manager stuff in everyday
life.  I am referring to environments.  Why should I have to
edit my ".cshrc" file (whatever that is) and include lines
like "setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH" and "setenv WINGZ" just to use
a stupid spreadsheet or editor?  Geesh, aren't the system
guys supposed to do that?  Or, better yet, aren't the
applications supposed to do that when they are installed?
Or, even better, aren't they supposed to be like the
Macintosh where they just *run*?!  All by themselves?!  No
need to pass GO; no need to ask the system guy what a
"<can't even remember the error message>" means?  To quote
The Talking Heads "My God, What Have I Done?"  Why do I use
this *&#!$!* stuff?!  I mean VMS (which wasn't that good
either) at least had system environments that all users
inherited and thus they didn't have to worry about an
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Oh, wait, that's right, while C++ is one small step
backwards for man, Unix is a one giant leap backwards for
mankind...

I think I've seen this one before, flashing by on my screen
as I trawl through manual pages looking for the particular
piece of nonsense I'm after, but for some reason today it
stopped where my eyes were resting, and I read it.  X "bug
compatibility" mode.  Bug compatibility?

Yeah, like, I've always thought this. X isn't nearly losing
enough.  It is important that it should support backward
compatibility with old bugs which were eliminated from the
server.  It's just what I need, is to turn on "bug
compatibility" mode.  Maybe it'll dump core more often if I
do that.

(Oh, here's another one -- a UNIX word processor which
dumped core on me the other day. What caused it to do this?
It got confused when writing out a file because -- the file
system overflowed.  Naturally, UNIX's answer to this is to
attempt to write a 12M core file to the same filesystem. I
wish I'd thought of this. I wonder if they patented that
idea?)

But sure enough, bug compatibility is just what it sounds
like. To quote, "Various pre-R4 clients pass illegal values
in some protocol requests, and pre-R4 servers did not
correctly generate errors in these cases.  Such clients,
when run against an R4 server, will terminate abnormally or
otherwise fail operate correctly.  *Bug compatibility mode
explicitly reintroduces certain bugs into the X server, so
that many such clients can still be run*."  (Let's ignore
that fact that I'm running R5, not R4, shall we?)

Oh God. I give up. They're never going to even try to remove
the grossness. They're going to build in
grossness-backward-compatibility.  I should have seen this
coming, really, shouldn't I?

Ok, guys. It's time for the ITS-for-Alpha port.

Subject: link-to-link -> lose

Symbolic links is one of those indispensable Unix features
that get in your way all the time.  I get the feeling it was
invented at a party on a Saturday night after work,
implemented in the wee hours of Sunday morning, shipped
Monday, and carefully thought out Tuesday.

I keep running across Makefiles that link two source files
together and compile them with different options to make two
objects from one source.  The commands look something like
this:

cc -c -DPLANES8 source.c
ln source.c source32.c
cc -c -DPLANES32 source32.c
rm -f source32.c
cc -o prog source.o source32.o ...

So what's wrong with this?  Nothing actually(1), if symbolic
links had been thought out properly.

Suppose you want to build "prog" for multiple architectures.
We might create a separate compilation directory for each
architecture, using "lndir" to make links back to the source
directory.  And we might use NFS to have the source
directory mounted on a central file server.  Wow, look at
all these great Unix features we're using!  Astute readers
will notice that we have passed the Threshold of Combinable
Unix Features(2) and are headed for certain failure.  Which
we are.

So the source directory looks something like this.  (Extra
credit: what do the permission bits on the two links mean?
See note 3.)

lrwxrwxr-x  1 gildea         19 Aug  8  1992 Makefile -> /srcs/prog/Makefile
lrwxrwxr-x  1 gildea         19 Aug  8  1992 source.c -> /srcs/prog/source.c
-rw-rw-r--  1 gildea      28136 Apr  7 13:43 source.o
...

What happens when we try to link source32.c to source.c?  A
reasonable system would make source32.c exactly the same as
source.c, that is, also a link to /srcs/prog/source.c.
Having determined what a reasonable system would do, let's
look at what Unix does:

$ ln source.c source32.c
ln: source32.c: Cross-device link

Hmm, Unix thinks I've typed "ln /srcs/prog/source.c
source32.c"(5).  Ok...since I'm creating a link to a
symbolic link to another file system, I have to make this a
symbolic link, too: "ln -s source.c source32.c".  So is the
Makefile broken?  No, "ln -s" wouldn't work on systems that
don't support symbolic links.  (So how can you write a
portable Makefile?  See note 6.)

You can't win.  It's Unix.

(2)  Experimentally determined to be 0.

It seems that Webster doesn't either say "no such word", or

greek letters--.  Instead, once it malfunctions on the first
try at one of these, the next two definitions (for anything,

Subject: NFS Automounter


>I've installed the NFS automounter on our system.

Be ready to LOSE. 

My experience with automount is that it repeatedly wedges
itself for no adequately explored reason and makes the
machine unusable until you reboot.  It's so annoying that we
have refrained from running automount (or amd, which suffers
similarly) on the GNU machines for years.  Bernard chose to
run amd on hal.gnu.one.two.thr, and half the time I try to
log into the machine it's completely wedged and unusable.  I
wish he'd turn the gd thing off.

Subject: Life's A Batch, Then You Get A Cron...


Cron went haywire today (big surprise, huh?) on one of the
netnews servers I maintain.  Since misery loves company, I
was tempted to put unix-haters@fsf.false-address.gnu on the
usenet alias so you could share in my joy at getting
peppered every 10 minutes by a demented process claiming it
couldn't run nntpsend (which was present, in the directory
it was supposed to be in, and with the permissions it was
supposed to have).  Merely killing cron and then restarting
it solved the problem.  Needless to say, I didn't succumb to
the temptation to redirect the mail, but I'll keep all you
wonderful folks in mind next time I have a few dozen spare
messages lying around.

Unix - not only doesn't it have a real scheduler, it doesn't
have a real batch submission system either.  Sorry if I
offend the saints of ITS by bringing up "lesser" operating
systems for the '10, but it's amazing how often I wish I had
Galaxy, damnit.

What a paragon of reliability.  Speaking of time, could it
be that now that it's well past the 20-year mark, Unix is
starting go go a little senile?  Why, not too long ago, I
had a time server lose its clock, and all the other machines
on the net happily decided that they, too, were back in
1970.  Kind of like your roommate's great aunt who the
police keep bringing back from the other side of town 'cause
she thinks she still lives in the house where she grew up
years and years ago...

Subject: Stop That Snickering In The Back!


I heard that!  If something is funny, why don't you share it
with the whole class, or perhaps you would like to stay
after school and reorganize all those little directories
under /usr/lib/terminfo?

All right, I'll share the joke.  You see, we Apollo users
can't help smirking, if not cracking up altogether, whenever
we see mail on unix-haters, about all those things that we
did right 10 years ago, and UNIX has done wrong all along.
(Those of us that also used ITS find it particularly
amusing.)  So, whenever you send mail about how screwed up
NFS (or whatever) is, and you hear the snickering and
laughter, that's us.  The recent mail about symbolic links
was the source of my recent outburst, for which I truly
apologize to the class.  You see, on Apollos, the following
three things are all INDEPENDENT and ORTHOGONAL:

    (1) the "mount" mechanism for allowing auxilliary disks
        or partitions to be made part of the file system

    (2) the networking mechanism for making all the file
        systems of all the machines on the local area
        network behave like one unified transparent global
        file system

    (3) the soft link mechanism for allowing an item in a
        directory anywhere in the global file system to be
        a text string naming some other object anywhere
        else in the global file system

What kind of flea-infested brain thought up the idea of
using the "mount" mechanism for doing networking, and then
had the audacity to charge people *MONEY* to *BUY* this
garbage is utterly beyond me.  When it became clear that it
was necessary to have every node in the network "mount"
every other node in order for the network to behave
rationally, and that this was creating incredible headaches
for network administration, did it occur to these people
that their design was fundamentally wrong and they should
throw it away and do it correctly?  No, they just added
"auto-mount" daemons.  Yes, folks, there are daemon
processes running around trying to frob your "mount tables"
so that the network will behave properly.

Somehow, the phone company managed to figure out how to do
this stuff without auto-mount daemons.  I never get an error
message from my telephone saying that such-and-such an area
code isn't mounted.

Anyway, to get to the point, on an Apollo network, ALL parts
of the global file system are accessible by the same name
from ALL points.  Mounting is used for auxilliary disks.
Once a disk is so mounted, it is of course automatically
part of the global file system, and immediately visible from
anywhere.  The symbolic link mechanism can link ANY point in
the global file system to ANY OTHER point, whether it
crosses the network or not.  Because all parts of the global
file system have universal system-wide names, the links JUST
WORK.  If we have a link like this:
       source.c -> /srcs/prog/source.c
meaning, of course, directory "srcs" relative to the root of
this node, and we link across the network to it, the "/srcs"
still means relative to the node in which the link lives,
rather than the node initiating the request.  That way, any
reference to that link will always wind up at the correct
file.

It really isn't that hard to do it right!!  Workstations
that do it right have been around for 10 years.

But I do get such an error message from my PBX.  Well, the
error message is not that specific, it's a busy signal or
something, but that's what it really means.  The f3ing piece
of s2t probably runs Unix and uses pipes to implement phone
calls.  We keep it in the same closet as the Unix systems
and other such slime infested garbage.

I would have thought that the collapse of "actually existing
socialism" would have disabused you of the Marxist notion of
linear progress.  In the world of Unix and Unix-like
computers (in which I would include Apollo DOMAIN, no
offense meant), everything gets progressively worse, not
better.  Except MIPS/$, which appears to be the sole
accepted measure of quality.

Well, if you really want another tumor... In fact, Motorola
System V/88 requires the above, but you must add more
commands if you have a group of developers.  In this case,
the move could fail if you are not the last person to
compile the file.

	cc -c -DPLANES32 source.c
        rm -f source32.o
	mv source.o source32.o

Even worse is the fact that the snotty cfront based
implementation refuses to accept .cxx as a C++ file
extension (treats it as a file to be passed to the linker).
Since we chose .cxx as the lcd which works on all systems
that we support but this one, the full script in all its
glory is (assuming source is a c++ file)

        rm -f source.C
        ln -s source.cxx source.C
	CC -c -DPLANES32 source.C
        rm -f source32.o
	mv source.o source32.o

Of course, since we started out by getting rid of ln usage,
those first two lines should probably read

        rm -f source.C
        cp source.c source.C

Why compiler writers can't all support some basic options
like -o and "believe me, its a source file, just disregard
that extension" is one of the imponderable mysteries of the
universe.  Or, more succinctly, FMHWATID.

Subject: A Nightmare

Last night I dreamed that the Real World had adopted the
"Unix Philosophy."

I went to a fast-food place for lunch.  When I arrived, I
found that the menu had been taken down, and all the
employees were standing in a line behind the counter waiting
for my orders.  Each of them was smaller than I remembered,
there were more of them than I'd ever seen before, and they
had very strange names on their nametags.

I tried to give my order to the first employee, but he just
said something about a "syntax error."  I tried another
employee with no more luck.  He just said "Eh?" no matter
what I told him.  I had similar experiences with several
other employees.  (One employee named "ed" didn't even say
"Eh?," he just looked at me quizzically.)  Disgusted, I
sought out the manager (at least it said "man" on his
nametag) and asked him for help.  He told me that he didn't
know anything about "help," and to try somebody else with a
strange name for more information.

The fellow with the strange name didn't know anything about
"help" either, but when I told him I just wanted to order he
directed me to a girl named "oe," who handled order entry.
(He also told me about several other employees I couldn't
care less about, but at least I got the information I
needed.)

I went to "oe" and when I got to the front of the queue she
just smiled at me.  I smiled back.  She just smiled some
more.  Eventually I realized that I shouldn't expect a
prompt.  I asked for a hamburger.  She didn't respond, but
since she didn't say "Eh?" I knew I'd done something right.
We smiled at each other for a little while longer, then I
told her I was finished with my order.  She directed me to
the cashier, where I paid and received my order.

The hamburger was fine, but it was completely bare... not
even a bun.  I went back to "oe" to complain, but she just
said "Eh?" a lot.  I went to the manager and asked him about
"oe."  The manager explained to me that "oe" had thousands
of options, but if I wanted any of them I'd have to know in
advance what they were and exactly how to ask for them.

He also told me about "vi," who would write down my order
and let me correct it before I was done, and how to hand the
written order to "oe".  "vi" had a nasty habit of writing
down my corrections unless I told her that I was about to
make a correction, but it was still easier than dealing
directly with "oe."

By this time I was really hungry, but I didn't have enough
money to order again, so I figured out how to redirect
somebody else's order to my plate.  Security was pretty lax
at that place.

As I was walking out the door, I was snagged in a giant Net.
I screamed and woke up.

Subject: Brave Little Ethernet Packet Goes To Mars


I haven't had much to say on this mailing list lately
because for the last year or so I've been spending so much
of my time loathing MS-DOS that I've had little time left
over in which to hate unix.  But this evening I had one of
those experiences that brings it all back.

See, on recent versions of Berkeley-derived unix there's
this thing called the Berkeley Packet Filter.  To someone
who has spent a year tracking TCP segments through what
passes for a debugging environment under MS-DOS, BPF could
be mistaken for a godsend.  Here's this nice built-in
mechanism that allows you to send and receive raw ethernet
packets, thus allowing you to track your TCP segments under
a debugger that (usually) doesn't crash the machine when it
hits a breakpoint.

Right.

So I spend a couple of days figuring out how to use this
thing.  Ok, nevermind that you have to tell this device what
the MTU is you want to support before you're allowed to ask
it what the MTU is of the interface you're trying to use,
and that if you get this wrong your read() calls will all
mysteriously fail.  Nevermind that this code won't tell you
how big the headers it puts on incoming packets will be,
because it wants to protect you against alignment problems
on three different processors that you're not using.
Nevermind that the ioctl() that's supposed to tell you what
the ethernet address is so that you can set it into the
filter program for the emulated micromachine that BPF uses
to throw away packets you don't want is broken, if you can
figure out how to program the micromachine at all, the only
person who understands this language is Van Jacobson, but
anyway, that ioctl() doesn't work so you've got to feed the
damned ethernet address back into the system via an
environment variable set by a shell script that grovels the
messages the kernel emits when it boots.  Nevermind all
that.  I've been in DOS hell, I've learned, like someone
from New Jersey, not to expect too much, I can adjust.  And
at least the output interface to BPF is nice and simple, you
just hand a packet and a file descriptor to the unix write()
call, that's it.

So I finally get this program written, run it, it looks
happy, I try to ping it from another machine.  Bupkiss.
That's ok, the whole reason for this is to be able to run a
debugger, right?  So I run my debugger and I see that the
ARP packets are coming in just fine, and we're processing
them just fine, and composing ARP responses just fine, and
all seems as happy as a clam, this should be working.

I'd still be wondering if I hadn't been using FTP software's
network monitor program and mis-typed a command.  See,
LANWATCH's running screen mode does different link-layer
protocols in different colors, so debugging TCP/IP stuff is
usually pretty bloody but occasionally descends into
Christmas mode when the bright green ARP packets start
mixing it up with the red IP packets.  But I screwed up the
filter command I tried to specify, and all of a sudden I
start seeing these black packets in response to the ARP
requests.

Wait a minute.  BLACK packets?  Black packets are packets
whose link layer type field isn't recognizable.  Oh no, I
have a bad feeling about this....

Yup.  Although unix requires that every other field you put
in an outgoing ethernet packet be in "network" order, it
wants to diddle around some more with the ethernet type
field and can't be bothered to store it somewhere else, so
it has you fill in the ethernet type field in "host" order
then byte swaps it for you when it's done screwing around.
It's wired into far too much code to change it.
Fortunately, there's an obvious answer, clear to any true
unix weenie: just byte swap the type field one more time in
the BPF write() driver routine.

I think I'll go and crash my unix box by running supdup now.

Subject: Building Emacs On A 108% Full Disk


So we just got this Sun Sparc-IPC box, kinda looks like a
caricature of a computer, all head, no body.  Came with a
200MB disk, which was almost entirely filled by a bunch of
OpenSomething GUI crud for the keyboard-impaired.  What it
didn't come with was emacs.

So, ok, I hand configure the ethernet interface and the
routing and slurp over a copy of emacs 18.59 from prep.  Oh,
right, I've got to slurp a copy of gzip too this year, ok.
So I build gzip, unzip (stop snickering, you in the back)
the tar file.  Hmm, not enough disk space to untar emacs.
Oh well, guess I don't need gzip anymore.

Hmm, still not enough space to untar emacs.  A couple of
iterations of trying to untar just the essential parts of
emacs by hand convince me that this is futile.  Ok, well,
I've got a huge disk on another machine, I'll untar emacs
there and move it over.

Oh dear, there are three files I have to edit to build
emacs.  How do I edit them without an editor?  Well, I can
edit them on the other machine and FTP them over.  Hey, wait
a minute, what about ange-ftp?  Yeah, that's it, I'll use
ange-ftp to edit the files remotely via the ftp server from
a machine where I've already got emacs running.  Gee, this
isn't so bad.

Go back over to the sparc, type "make", it says "huh?  I
don't see anything here to make".  Hmm, how did that
makefile I just edited get to be zero length?  And the other
two config files I just edited too.

Oh.

See, all that source code I just moved over drove the disk
usage up to about 108% full, so only root's allowed to
allocate disk blocks now.  But I edited the three config
files logged in as myself, forgetting that this is unix,
where successful completion of a file write operation
doesn't mean that your bits ever got anywhere near the disk.

It seems that if you tell the ftp server to write a file
onto a disk that's more than 100% full, it says "ok, file
transferred successfully" and truncates the file.  Unless of
course you're logged in as root, in which case it says
exactly the same thing but writes the bits out.

In a final gesture of futility, after finally getting emacs
built, I went and read the tunefs man page, which allows you
to fiddle the magic number that determines how full a unix
filesystem is allowed to get.  The default value is 10,
which means that filesystems can get up to 111% full.  It is
possible to set the magic number to zero, which would limit
the disk to only getting 100% full, but, warns the tunefs
man page, having your disk only be allowed to get 100% full
is bad for your disk throughput.

Subject: Where'd *This* Come From?


So, here I am, puttering along on this UNIX box, when I
notice a core file in the root directory.  Hmmm, I sez, that
wasn't there before I booted this beast.  So I tried to look
at the file with dbx, then gdb.  No luck -- the debuggers
couldn't read it.  Try strings on it -- no luck; no strings.
Bring up the core file in emacs.  Hmmm -- looks like
something from startup.  But the machine started up fine,
and there's no hint in either the log files or in the core
file of what program may have done this.

So, delete the core file, check the logs, boot the machine.
Machine comes up, core comes back.  Same size, looks the
same inside.

So, why doesn't UNIX have some way of finding out what
program barfed?  A core file is a large turd on the disk.  A
few more bytes in it wouldn't be that bad.  Also, supposedly
the startup winnage and lossage all ends up in log files, or
spewed on the screen.  Nada in this case.  Sigh.  Yet more

You obviously aren't sufficiently infused with the Tao of
Unix.  The proper way to handle this problem is to put "rm

Not to mention mixed platform, mixed GUI cut-and-paste
problems.  I am a system manager for both VMS and Ultrix
systems.  I use an Ultrix machine running Motif for my GUI,
while most of the VMS users have DECwindows.

The main problem is the differing cut-and-paste buttons:
Motif uses the middle button, while DECwindows uses the
right button (assuming a right-handed mouse set-up).  This
becomes a problem when I run a standard DECwindows
applications with the display on Motif.  Only the left mouse
button (select text) remains constant.

Plus, some DECwindows applications (notably DECwindows Mail)
like to reset the cut-and-paste buffer if you switch input
focus to a certain window.  (E.g., DECwindows Mail seems to
put the text of the current message in the cut-and-paste
buffer automatically.)  My autofocus mouse (ala Sun) wreaks
havoc with this.  Many times I have selected text in one
window, moved the mouse to a terminal window, pasted, and
had the entire contents of a mail message run as Unix
commands because I had accidentally had my mouse cross over
the DECwindows Mail window (focusing input briefly on it).

My solution?  Live with it.  It has not gotten to a point
yet where I feel the need to hunt down the various settings
files (*if* this is possible) to fix the problems by
creating "Laffer's own standard GUI set-up".  Being a system
manager, I use a good variety of computers and their various
GUIs frequently.  Furthermore, I have to help users a lot,
and I have found that if I customize my own GUI and shell
settings too much, then I can't function with the standard
GUI and shell commands.  (It is very embarrassing to type
all of these arcane short-cut aliases in front of a user at
her/his terminal, and have them not work!  You look
incompetent....)

How to practice safe cut-and-paste practices?  *NEVER* paste
into a terminal window with a superuser session (be it
"SYSTEM" or "root").  This means one has to type it all,
possibly leading to transcription errors, but one should
always double-check important commands anyway.

Of course, as Ms. Z's message shows, a lot of times pasting
into a superuser session window is unintentional.  More than
once I have gone to scroll my xterm window (using the middle
button in the scroll-bar area), only to hit the middle
button a microsecond too early.  BLAM!  I've just pasted a
mail message into my VMS SYSTEM session, and all of its
contents are being interpreted as commands.  Luckily nothing
major has happened because of this!

Sometimes I think going back to a good old VT100 terminal
would be safer all around....

Unix reminds us to strive for perfection.  The file you were

Subject: Every Bug A Feature.  An ESSENTIAL Feature.

[I've removed the original author's name and a bit of
identifying information because he was concerned about
retaliation from high-level Unix zealots who consider Unix
"strategic".  If someone wants to add him to the list I can
provide the mailing address.]


Yep, I'm all too familiar with the format and usage of Unix
ar archives.  I had to implement support for them in the xxx
product, which is actually a port to Unix of the yyy link
editor.  It accepts both yyy object files and Unix a.out
format object files and ar archives.

Linker (either ld or xxx) processing of archives is
different depending on whether or not ranlib has been run
over the archive.  If the archive does not have a
ranlib-provided symbol index in it, the linker searches the
symbol table of each archive element, in the order that they
appear in the archive, exactly once for names on the
unresolved external symbol list.  It includes the object
file from the archive if it resolves a symbol.  But if a
ranlib index is there, the Linker searches the index
repeatedly, including those modules that define external
symbols, until a pass over the index doesn't result in
including any new modules.  A ranlibed archive is thus
processed similar to the way the yyy link editor handles a
library.

There is one other curious quirk in Unix archive processing.
Ranlib is a very simple-minded program and only examines the
"external" bit in symbol definitions in the a.out symbol
table.  If the external bit is lit, the name is entered in
the index.  This means that the index includes not only
external symbol definitions, which it should, but also
common block definitions, which it shouldn't.  Finding a
name in the index thus doesn't necessarily mean that the
module should be loaded--the linker still has to process the
module's symbol table to see if the symbol that caused the
module to be loaded is really a global symbol definition and
not a common block name.  Ld takes the brute-force approach
to this problem.  Whenever it gets a hit in the ranlib
index, it loads the module.  It then looks up the symbol
that caused the module to be loaded, and if it was really a
common block symbol, it unloads the module.  The problem is,
ld has already maximized the size of any common blocks that
may have been seen in the now-unloaded module, and it has no
way to back that out.  So the size of a common block is not
the maximum size declared by any module that is linked into
the executable image, but rather the maximum size that ld
ever saw in any module that it processed during library
searches.

It turns out that the Unix stdio library on bsd Unix and zzz
depends on this crock of ld processing for correct
behavior--the stdio file variable vector for stdin, stdout,
and stderr is a common block dimensioned 3 in some places
and 2 or 1 in others, depending on whether the module in
question references stdout or stderr.  But the code
references element [2] in the array even if it's only
dimensioned [2] or [1]!!  The stdio routines only work
because ld always loads (and usually then unloads) a module
that has the common block dimensioned [3] and so the size of
the common block is always maximized to this value.  When I
first did the product, I was unaware of this dependency on a
bug in ld, I didn't have the bug, and so most programs using
stdio were dying with illegal memory accesses.  It took a
week to figure out what ld was up to.  We ended up writing
the same crock into xxx.

And people wonder why xxx folks tend to sneer at Unix.......

   Subject: X Terminals - Update

   The ban on X terminal reboots applies only to X
   terminals that connect to a Sun host. All other X
   terminals can be rebooted under situations that make it
   necessary, but only then: there is still the potential
   for problems when this is done.

   Terminals attached to Sun's should not be rebooted until
   FURTHER NOTICE. It appears that a change in some
   configuration in the main campus computing network is
   leading to some rather hairy problems on our own
   network, and the terminals are the trigger for this.



   ps. for the technically curious, the reason the Sun X
       terminals are affected is that they normally boot
       using RARP, after trying BOOTP without success. They
       now believe themselves to be succeeding using BOOTP,
       even though "success" means possession of an illegal
       IP address.

       Terminals that boot from DECstations are able to use
       BOOTP directly, although it is still possible that a
       race condition exists between our local BOOTP
       servers and the new "helpers" in C&C's domain.

Given all the discussion of sending FQDN's as anonymous FTP
passwords, I just thought that I'd cloud the issue by
pointing out that MVS mainframes have a rather short
restriction on the password length (I don't remember what it

However, when I ran it, this is what I found:

Indeed, she said "It's Unix...", and I thought I detected a

remarkably good job in that movie from a realism perspective
- everything from using out-of-the-box SGI demo packages for

alt.flame would be inappropriate if the material in question

the data is about things of general interest (like how much
certain people make).

Or, you could just put it up for anonymous ftp with the X

Alpine Lace cheese with thousands of tiny holes in it which
you could never plug all of.  You can wrap it in saran wrap,

Subject: Logging A Copy Of Your Interactive SENDs

Hi, all.

Didn't there used to be a day when you could send an
interactive terminal message over a network and:

[a] it would pretty much ALL get there (not just the
     first N bytes)

[b] you could review a log of all sends you'd received
     since logging in, just in case your screen scrolled?

:PRSEND on ITS, for example?

It's 1993.  UNIX still hasn't figured out how to do this.
Project Loki, the pathetic Unix-steeped remnant of a
university which once knew something about computers (TLA),
has a great solution: ZEPHYRgrams.  They often reach their
destination.  And as long as they're only a couple of lines,
they even reach their destination intact.

But beware!  If you miss a Zephyrgram because your Emacs is
refreshing the screen, hey, that's life.

I wanted my Zephyr client (ZWGC) to copy messages to a file
so I could do a :PRSENDS.  An Loki friend suggested
several intuitive solutions.  He pointed out that the "best"
way is to modify the Zephyrgram client description file,
according to the man page, so it automatically logs
messages.

Sure enough, ZWGC has an entire embedded programming
language (they used to teach us to add things called
"features" to our programs, so our users didn't need to
learn another embedded language to use something that just
receives interterminal messages).  Alas, none of the
statements in the documentation that would be used to
implement log files have examples supplied, and several
hours of playing were unable to get them to stop breaking
ZWGC.

Maybe if I send a long enough Zephyrgram, it will overwrite
a stack frame somewhere, enabling me to create a virus which
will restore some semblance of design and robustness to an
otherwise bleak and empty universe.

	[proposed solution]

   I would expect you to get two copies of every zgram with
   that.

   One way would be to put "set skip_tty_startup" in your
   ~/.environment
		...

   Alternatively, you could still run two zwgc's, and use:

	   /usr/etc/zwgc -ttymode > /tmp/alllus-sends &

   so that the second one only writes to the file, instead
   of going both to the file and your screen.

   Finally, you could copy /usr/loki/lib/zephyr/zwgc.desc
   to ~/zwgc.desc, then edit it a bit to get each and every
   zwgc you run to both display and log zgrams.  This is
   probably the best solution, but I'm not going to take
   the time now to figure out how.  Read the zwgc man page
   and figure it out!

Gee, DM, glad to see you're making such, ah,

By the way, this was forwarded to me by one of the folks I

Subject: Forwarded: MTBF daemon

  From the net:

Sun Microsystems has long been aware that too high a value
for system MTBF (measured in days or fractions thereof)
leads to a stultifying sense of boredom and complacency on
the part of the network administrator.

Thoughtfully, SUN has incorporated the little-known MTBF
daemon, which is quietly spawned at boot time, to ensure
that all users are exposed to the excitement of real
breakdowns at reasonable intervals.  MTBFd is intelligent
insofar that it automatically detects the busiest server on
the network and grafts itself onto the server's sendmail
daemon.  Lifeboat simulations are no substitute for that
first actual file-scrambling catastrophe.  Quoting the MTBFd
(8) man page, "it's not actually data corruption, as we use
a special write-only encryption algorithm."

The initial panic and wringing of throats soon gives way to
the familiar elation of the front-line soldier under fire:
sinews are stiffened, blood is summoned.  Site-wide
solidarity is magically rewoven as an almost forgotten
camaraderie emerge to weather the blitz.

"For the system administrator shall lie down with the
controls engineer, yea, even the simple coder shall lie down
with the OI group leader." -- St. Presper's Epistolary
Update to the Pascalites, Release V, Level 1.2.

The traditional supplier/user frictions also, suprisingly,
disappear since the user is now, as it were, a born-again
nonuser, and by definition a prospect for *something*.
Long-forgotten salespersons will arrive to offer condolences
and quotations for extended and enhanced service: contracts,
add-ons, RAID systems, UPSes, upgrades, and newly-released
allegedly working software.

Eventually, the peaceful boredom of uptime will be restored,
prisoners exchanged, scapegoats tried and executed,
memorials erected to lost files, and a candle placed on the
console to honor the Unknown Coder.

Typical pile of Sun marketing hooey.  MTBF daemons have been

The only thing Sun has done is pick a fancy name for code
that's been integrated into the kernel for years.

I presume they said "lost or currupted" to hide the real
breakdown of 99.44% of files lost due to accidentally misuse
of, or typos in, an "rm" command, and 0.36% due to actual
corruption.

Admitting that most of this work could be saved by fixing a

(dare I say it?) an *improvement* to take place in Unix, and
we certainly couldn't have that.

Please inform RB, when he returns from his much-needed

that produced the message below.  The problem is that the

gives me about which message of mine it was that prompted

In fact, I have no memory of sending RB any mail at all, so
I'm concerned that it might be about something important
that I have forgotten.  Furthermore I have no memory of who
RB is, and this message doesn't include his last name.  I
can guess his last name starts with a B, but a quick flip
though my rolodex doesn't turn up any RB's among the B's.

After we get this all straightened out, someone should
really complain to the authors of the vacation program and

To the person who posted the text of my vacation message to
this mailing list:

Shame on you.  This was my first perl program, and aside
from not detecting or pointing out to the recipient that my
vacation message might have come to you via my membership in
a mailing list to which you posted rather than from a
private message directed to me, the program ran flawlessly.

I'd appreciate greater consideration for the difficulty of
crafting software to handle the many nuances of email
transmission.  (Having subscribed to a variety of mailing
lists, I can state with certainty that writing a
general-case program to handle Sender, Reply-To, From, and
Subject headers and dispatch them based on potential list
membership would be quite a job, since there isn't a
standard for mailing list management software.)

Fear not that this particular vacation program will fall
into the hands of anyone else.  But I think posting my
personal message, with personal contact information, to a
mailing list like this was UNCALLED FOR.

Thank you.

P.S.  Why the arrogance, anger and hostility in your

The RIGHT solution is to create a new newsgroup,

From the "Acknowledgments" section of Scott Meyers' book
"Effective C++:

"In the two decades that have passed since [I first learned

So several orders of magnitude improvement on the hardware

A friend who's also on Unix-Haters sent me this offline
commentary:

    Is this guy kidding, or what?  I sure hope so, because
    he needs to be killed otherwise... what a whiner! "perl

I say, maybe you ought to get your Commodore PET out and go
back to programming BASIC.  Unix-Haters is for flaming about
flaws in Unix (of which there are plenty), not for passing
the buck about your inability to code, inability to design
software, inability to test software, or inability to cope.

*YOU* voluntarily made a decision to write software that
deals with the nether regions of the Unix mailer.  Don't
come whimpering to *us* when you discover that it's a dark,
spoogey place; we already knew that.

*YOU* also voluntarily made a decision to put your first try
at a new programming language on public display by making it
critical path for your e-mail.  When it embarasses you, you
should think about your poor judgement rather than flaming
people for not cutting you slack since it was your first try
with a new language.

Bullshite.  Does the "To:" field contain your name?  If not,
keep the drivel about when you're not going to be around to
yourself.

If it does, try to finger the reply-to address.  Except in
very rare instances, you can't finger a mailing list (unless
some loser set up an admin account that matches the list
name when fingerd does fuzzy matching).  If you can't finger
it, then don't send the gd vacation message.  Fair enough?
If you get a hostname lookup failure, then send the message
anyway, since nobody is stupid enough in 1993 to run a mail
burster on a machine that isn't actually on the internet.
And if they do, they deserve to lose.

If you had made just one more error in your program, it
would have gone to the list anyway.  What's your gripe?

Oh yeah, and about the hostility in our messages, this is

grip.  Deal.

And post something about how bad Unix sucks rather than
whining about your ability to test your own code before you
put it into production, or I'll start the petition
circulating to have AB kick your sorry a$$ off of Unix-

Subject: My First Perl Program

Dear Sir,

I appreciate your hurt feelings.  I understand both that
writing proper mail-groveling software is difficult and that
you do not feel that others should criticize programs that
you write for your personal use.  However, by installing the
program as a network daemon, you have thereby -forced-
others to use it too.

If you wrote a quick hack as your first perl program, I
doubt that you would send it to comp.sources or sell it for
$400 to PC users.  But by setting it up so that it gets run
automatically every time someone sends you a message, you
have forced more people to run it, involuntarily, than would
have run it if you had posted it to comp.sources in the
first place.

Imagine that you wrote new software for your internet
gateway and it started spraying bogus routing packets around
the internet.  Such things have happened in the past, and
they have brought large chunks of the net to a standstill.
Would it then be appropriate to respond that it was your
first C program?

The question is not whether it is a reasonable expectation
that you get a program right the first time when programming
in a new language, but whether it is a reasonable action to
force a large number of strangers to use it when you have
already decided that it is not a reasonable expectation that
it will work the first time.

What sort of stinking Unix-like flame is this?  You've done
the same thing that ld did, but with your problem.  You just
report that it happened, you don't amuse us or enlighten us!

I'm getting really sick of people copying a tiny transcript
of some well-known-to-be-broken Unix utility (as if there
were any that are not broken) and merely forwarding it to
the list without spending the time to write a
seriously-obnoxious, intensely-abusive flame.

If you are not willing to take the time to pour out your
bile on all of AT&T, Berkeley, Ken Thompson, Bill Joy, and
everyone else involved (they are all guilty by association)
in this comedy of stupidity, errors, and infinitely poor
judgement called Unix, don't send a message!!!

Heck, if I wrote a message like the above every time that
Unix screwed me, you would not have time to do whatever your
employer pays you to do, since you would be busy hitting the
#\D key in your favorite losing mail-reading utility trying
to flush the infinitely long stream of tiny transcripts
spewing from my mailer.

Think before you act!  You don't deserve to be on
unix-haters if you don't.  If there is anything that Unix
programmers can be characterized by is precisely that they
don't do that (of course, they don't think at all).

AB, isn't it time for a new shakedown?  I'm starting to hit

Sorry, but I don't see any indication that ld reported

to report anything when it has got the csh there to print
one of its two universal diagnostics for it?  And as an
additional bonus it left me 8491440 bytes of data in a file

        Ahem.  Maybe you forgot that you're supposed to
        read the manual page and be intimately familiar
        with software before you use it.  Moreover, you are
        not allowed to make typos, and should always say
        exactly what you mean.

What in heaven's name makes you think the user here didn't
read the manual page, was not intimately familiar with the
software, committed a typo, or didn't mean what he said?

Do you see something on the ld manual page, or anywhere in
the Unix documentation, that says that ld ISN'T supposed to
dump core when invoked this way?  Did you ever consider the
possibility that the far-seeing developers INTENDED THIS TO
HAPPEN?  What do YOU think "ld -o" means?

        If the people at Berkeley and AT&T had spent all
        their time implementing error handlers and doing
        sanity checking on their code, Unix would never
        have gotten to where it is today!

Oh, but they DID!  After all, the system didn't crash in
response to the segmentation fault.  It got trapped, and an
error message got printed.  While it isn't shown, chances
are pretty good that the user got his prompt back.  This
isn't MS/DOS, you know!

You want them to waste time writing ADDITIONAL error
handlers and sanity checks into every little junky program
like ld?  That's against the Unix philosophy!  Each tools
does ONE thing.  ld links object files.

Checking for errors and printing error messages is someone
in else's bailiwick.  (You know, I wonder if any of the Unix
philosophers spent a few decades working in some big
bureaucracy, where the operative pharse was "It's not my
job".)

   Did you ever consider the possibility that the
   far-seeing developers INTENDED THIS TO HAPPEN?  What do
   YOU think "ld -o"


I got curious about this after I discovered that the 'ld' on
my Sun-4 did this too.  I went and looked at the source for
'ld'.  Don't do this just after lunch, that's a BIG mistake.
IN fact, looking at the source at all was a serious mistake.
Ecch.

This stupid program scans its argument list not once, not
twice, but at least THREE times that I could find.  I
couldn't stomach any more searching.  After I found two
places where a '-o' option with no trailing argument would
provoke a segmentation fault, I stopped looking.

It's just sloppy coding.  There's no excuse for it.  The
first loop over the arguments (looking for the zflag,
whatever the hell that is) just blithely increments the
argument index when it sees '-o'.  Next time around the
loop, it gets incremented again and POW! you're off the end
of the array.

The funny thing is, this shite wasn't in there when I hacked
on ld back in the mid-80's.  Sure enough, looking along a
little farther, I find

	case 'o':
		if(++c >=argc)
			error(1, "-o: arg missing");

of course, this is in the third pass over the args, by which
time it's too late!

Those bozos at Sun screwed up another perfectly good
program.  Well, OK, they made an already mildly losing
program lose BIGTIME.

And I haven't even gotten into the guts of the program, this
is still just the ARGUMENT PROCESSING!  Ghreat Ghreen Ghods

Excuse me, I have to go throw up now.

   What sort of stinking Unix-like flame is this?...

   Think before you act!  You don't deserve to be on
   unix-haters if you don't....

   AB, isn't it time for a new shakedown?  I'm starting to
   hit the #\D key every time that I see a message
   addressed to unix-haters.

I fear that I have become burned out in my role as guardian
of the vitriol, chief hate-monger, grand disciplinarian, and
most exalted screaming maniac.

More and more often, things are happening to me that should
make me compose a rant for Unix-Haters, but I can't seem to
summon the energy.  For example, I recently learned of
several new ways in which NFS fails to be an actual file
system, I have discovered that one Unix vendor's manual
pages have been rendered almost useless by over-zealous
technical writers, and I have been shafted in multiple ways
by the Unix/Kerberos notion of "security".  In none of these
cases have I shared my righteous wrath with you all.

Thus I have felt for some time that I should pass the flame
on to someone who still can summon up a good head of steam
when necessary.  In fact, several weeks ago I picked 10
members of this list and asked them to form a nominating
committee to pick a new Unix-Haters Czar -- or suggest some
other way of reorganizing me out of a job.  After some brief
discussion, this effort failed to produce any results.

So when I got GR's flame quoted above, I immediately went
downstairs to his office and asked him if -he- would
consider being the new Unix-Haters Czar.  He accepted.

We haven't worked out the details yet, but starting with
this message, GR's word is law.  I'll still be on
Unix-Haters-Request (along with PB and MP), so I might
answer your request to change your address, but you won't be
hearing from me in this forum again except as a regular
contributor.

Keep the faith: it -can- be better than Unix.

FOR RELEASE JUNE 22, 1993


THE WORST MANUAL OF THE YEAR:
A COMPETITION FROM HELL

        If you've ever felt let down by a VCR manual,
frustrated by your computer's documentation, or downright
crazed by the instructions for some toy, here's your chance
to fight back.  You can nominate that lousy manual to be
acclaimed as "The Worst Manual of the Year."

        Sponsored by the Anonymous Company, a group of
experienced and fed-up professional writers, the competition
for the worst manual of the year aims to shame manufacturers
into providing manuals we can actually use.  The best
consumer companies have improved a lot, over the last few
years, says JP, President of the Anonymous Company Circle.
But there are still too many bad manuals out there.  You
usually can't find what you need, and if you do find it, you
can't understand what they're saying, or the diagram's such
a mess you give up.

        JP urges you to send in those abominable manuals.
Look through your pile of manuals and send us the one that
helps you the least, frustrates you the most, and generally
makes your life miserable.  Write a short note saying why
you're nominating this book as your candidate for the Worst
Manual of the Year.  We don't care what year it was printed;
if you used it this year, and you hate it, tell us why.

        If your candidate wins (or places), you get a custom
T-shirt showing the cover of the manual selected as Worst
Manual of the Year, with the slogan, I fingered the Worst
Manual of the Year, 1993.  As a bonus, you get a copy of
JP's Book That Needs Publicity, and a certificate of honor
in the war against useless manuals.

        The Anonymous Company will announce the Worst
Manual of the Year to the press on December 7, 1993;
distribute copies of your letters (anonymously if you wish);
and award the offending company a garish Certificate of Bad
Taste.  To correct their errors, the company will also
receive a copy of How Not To Do Anything by JP and HK. So
scan those shelves.  Which manual has caused you the most
grief this year?

Mail the book with your complaints to:

The Worst Manual of the Year
c/o The Anonymous Company
666 La Ha See Enda, N.N.
LowDown, ZZ 99999.

Absolute last-chance deadline for submitting monster manuals:
Halloween, 1993.

This press release has been distributed widely across the
internet. But if you know another list or a personal net-friend
who might want to read it, please forward it on.

If you have any questions about the contest, please write
N. O. Wun at NOW@later.than.now. Please don't send
descriptions of manuals via e-mail, though. We need to get
those, along with a copy of the horror text, in the mail.

Please let us know when you send in the manuals on what list

Thanks for reading, and go get those miserable manuals!

Subject: I Think I Understand Unix Better Now


This isn't really a complaint about Unix. In fact, I will
actually offer a slight amount of praise -- at the end, of
course. What I really want to talk about is how I suddenly
grew to understand the implications of the Unix philosophy,
and how it appears to be permeating our society.

Today, I tried to phone someone who works at Sun World
and/or Next World magazines.  I called their main number and
was dropped into an automated voice-mail telephone operator
system.  Press 1 for this, 2 for that, and never a press to
reach a human.  No options reached a department: either you
knew how to spell the person's last name, or you wandered
endlessly in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike,
until you stumbled over the rusty knife that disconnected
you.

It can truly be said that whoever designed that voice mail
system, learned the lessons of Unix to perfection: "if it
was hard to do, it should be hard to understand." The really
frightening thing is that the people who write about Unix
seem to accept this monstrosity.

Oh, yes, I was going to praise some part of Unix, wasn't
I. Well, I've been using "ed" as my editor for the past
year. It has the one, single, advantage that it is so
boringly uninteresting that no Unix Wizard has seen fit to
create ed++ and, thus, it has stumbled along for the 15
years I've suffered under the yoke of Unix slavery without
"improvements." Amazing, isn't it, how hard one must stretch
to find something -- anything -- to praise?

Happy Hacking

Subject: WARNING!


As of today, I've become the new unix-haters czar or
dictator.  I plan to take this duty seriously.

What this means:

- I will flush from the list people who send inappropriate
messages.  I will flush them without warning, but, unlike
your favorite losing Unix utility (insert any here) I will
send them a notice telling them that I have done so.

- If the person in question is in a redistribution list, and
I cannot get the person flushed, I will unceremoniously
flush the _entire_ redistribution list.  Here I will act
like "rm *" to remind the people involved how losing Unix
_really_ is so that they'll have something to flame about.

What are appropriate messages?  The unix-haters welcome
message, attached at the end, should remind you.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The previous two messages sent to the list
(by GH and MM) are inapropriate.  Had I sent the present
message earlier, as I had planned to, I would have flushed
both.

This will be the last warning.

------- Begin Greeting
Welcome to Unix-Haters.

Remember, every message sent to Unix-Haters must say
something bad about Unix.  This rule is strictly enforced.
People have been removed from this list for merely
correcting other people's honest confusions.  All
contributions should be -original- as well -- simply
repeating "Unix is Evil" for the 100th time isn't good
enough and will simply irritate the moderators.  (And we're
pretty irritable since we have to use Unix too).

A good rule of thumb: If you are composing mail to
Unix-Haters, and you started with the "reply" command (you
typed "r" in emacs rmail mode), then stop right there, your
message probably doesn't belong here.  Think: "would the
message I am sending still seem appropriate next week?".  If
your answer is "no", then don't send it.  If your answer is
"yes", then send it next week.

over and over again, as they shuffle relentlessly towards
me, clutching hideous kludges that they claim are "Internet

In vain, I throw copies of the actual Internet protocol

BTW, it's worse than it appears.  The problem kind of WAS an
incorrect password: I had accidentally set a 9-character
password.  The same program that let me SET that password
with no complaint would not accept it for verification when
I wanted to change it.  (It WOULD accept it when I left off
the 9th character.)  The Epei software is "partially"
converted to Kerberos.  Some of it takes 9 character
passwords; some of it doesn't.  None of the error messages
you get when you use a 9 character password with software
that doesn't accept it give you any hint of what might be
wrong.  "The competent programmer will know what to do."

Please tell me it doesn't always have to be like this.
Please tell me that this is only the result of force-fitting
code into 640K to run on .5 MIP machines.  Please tell me
that when Unix runs on 1 MIP workstations with a few meg of
memory it will finally grow up.

What?  You say this is on a many-MIP multiprocessor machine
with tens of megs of memory?  And gigabytes of disk (but no

I've got this spiffy (read "inexpensive") SparcClassic.  It
was running Solaris 2.1.  Compared to Solaris 2.0, 2.1 was a
major advance, like electric lightbulbs over gas lamps.  But
it did have this problem that it would occasionally die.
This only seemed to happen if there was a big load on the
machine, a lot of processes trying to run.  And that only
happened during my nightly software build. I would come in
in the morning and find my machine totally catatonic.  Even
the kiss-of-death L1-A had no effect.  Fortunately Suns boot
fast.

Solaris 2.1 was also blessed with a really awful process
scheduler.  If you tried to do a compile you could no longer
use X.  Moving the mouse would result in nothing for large
amounts of time, followed by the little arrow on the screen
zipping way past where you wanted it to go.  But that's OK.
I got used to doing a "M-x compile <RET>" and stepping into
somebody else's office to chat.

Well, along came Solaris 2.2, with promises of enhanced
performance ("90% improvement in fileserver
performance!...")  So my machine got upgraded.  The good
news is that the machine is noticeably faster in normal use.
Context switch time is improved; I can actually do other
things (like read netnews) while a compile is going on.

The bad news is that doing a compile often causes the system
to go into a deadlock state where it no longer fields NFS
requests.  L1-A time.  But that's OK, it boots fast.  I've
got this chart on my wall, showing how many times a day I
have had to reboot because of this problem:

	7/20	4
	7/21	2
	7/22	1
	7/23	4
	7/26	5
	7/27	1
	7/28	4

I've learned to not do any builds on my machine.  Instead I
do builds on other machines here that are still running
Solaris 2.1.  My workstation now effectively operates as a X
server.  This is what is known as "progress."

a) I try to send it to HDKOIS and cc it to info-explorer.  I
   know HDKOIS (once created -- around the time that
   RandomCo was really getting into swing -- as a list for
   commenting on the sad state of computer hardware at the
   AI Lab; said state resulting from the exodus of skilled
   hackers to RandomCo) no longer exists, but I'm using it
   as a bitter comment on the inevitable arrival of the
   future, the ephemerality of all things, the poignancy of
   the passage of days that take with them their hopes and
   worries and failures, all now as distant as those hours
   in early childhood, the sun entering through the window
   and making its way across the carpet through all of an
   impossibly long afternoon, the crisp air, the leaves
   falling outside, all gone now.  All gone.

b) My wunnerful Unix mailer tells me that HDKOIS doesn't
   exist, so the message wasn't sent.  It really does say
   that the message wasn't sent.  I have run into this
   before with Unix mailers; I know that occasionally,
   depending on whether SM's hemorrhoids itch today,
   Mr. Happy Unix Mailer will entirely punt a message to
   multiple recipients just because it couldn't find one of
   them.

c) Well, so just for the purpose of having this tiny bit of
   fun, I create the mailing list, put a few randoms who
   are no longer at the Lab on it, and re-send the message.

d) I get a message from AB telling me that there is still an
   HDKOIS on MC, and if I am resurrecting the list, what do
   I want done with the old one? and by the way, Mister
   Think-You're-So-Funny, there IS a news reader for Lisp
   Machines, ptooey.

e) I receive a copy of the second message I sent to HDKOIS
   and INFO-EXPLORER.

f) I receive a copy of the first message I sent to HDKOIS
   and INFO-EXPLORER, which the Unix mailer had told me
   hadn't been sent.

I am depressed now, okay?  Now I am sad.  Not just because I
gambled with Unix -- and lost; but also because this means
that the net-news sickness did indeed make it all the way to
the Lisp Machines.  Next I expect to hear that there's a
great news reader running in ITS EMACS on the KLH-10.

Subject: Lie To Me Baby, Lie To Me

FTP says:

  13772 bytes sent in 0.06 seconds (2.2e+02 Kbytes/s)

Let's see, that works out to be 1802240 bits per second.
That's a pretty good trick, considering our connection is a
measly 56000 bits per second.

Oh, and nice of it to print "2.2e+02" instead of "220", I
thought there just wouldn't have been enough characters on
the screen otherwise.

And isn't it special how FTP will also say

  Hash mark printing on (8192 bytes/hash mark).

and then proceed to print hash marks every 584 bytes
instead?  But of course it only does this when doing
transfers in BINARY mode, when it's in "please-
silently-mangle-my-files-by-stripping-off-the-high-bit,-won't-you?"
mode, the number of hash marks printed corresponds roughly
to what it claimed it would be.

But in the grand unix tradition, I've gotten used to waiting
until ange-ftp tells me that 1400% of the file has been
transferred before thinking it is done, and I'm getting
faster at reading scientific notation as well.  Unix made me
a better person!  (Or is that bitter?)

This appeared in a message requesting papers for the "USENIX
SYMPOSIUM ON VERY HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES (VHLL)":

  UNIX has long supported very high level languages:
  consider awk and the various shells.  Often programmers
  create what are essentially new little languages whenever
  a problem appears of sufficient complexity to merit a
  higher level programming interface -- consider
  sendmail.cf.  In recent years many UNIX programmers have
  been turning to VHLLs for both rapid prototypes and
  complete applications.  They take advantage of these
  languages' higher level of abstraction to complete
  projects more rapidly and more easily than they could
  have using lower-level languages.

So now we understand the food chain of advanced UNIX
languages:

  level		languages		      analogous organism
  -----		---------		      ------------------
  low		assembler (low-level PDP)     amoeba
  intermediate	regular expressions	      tadpole
  high		C (high-level PDP)	      monkey

	We all know by now that unix uptime epochs should be
considered disposable.  You boot your machine and use it
until the OS loses track of all of the resources it was
supposed to be managing, then you reboot it.  Of course, the
unix box isn't smart enough to tell you that it is out of
resources -- that would be too hard and might require
resources as well.  Besides, we have to make sure there's
enough work left out of the OS to make sure the local unix
wizard remains an essential part of the installation.

	Well, it seems those new fangled unix distributed
filesystems (e.g.  AFS), inherit this mode of lossage from
their progenitors (is this what they mean by C++ providing
unix systems with inheritance?).

Subject: OLTP on the Berzerkeley Fast File System, anyone?


Every so often, our abUsenet server goes down unexpectedly,
as Unix boxes are wont to do.  Unfortunately, INN (the news
transport system we're running) has no
checkpointing/roll-forward/roll-back on its databases -
they're open and naked as long as the server is up.  So you
have to regenerate the databases from scratch if the server
goes down - a process that takes 5 hours or so.  But even
better than that, sometimes the innd server bites the big
one and scrambles my active file.  For those of you who
aren't unlucky enough to have to look after one of these
beasts, the "active" file is a list of tuples, one for each
newsgroup.  They contain the name of the group, message IDs
of the first and last messages currently on the server, and
a boolean for whether the group is moderated or not.

Anyhow, the scrambling bore and interesting similarity to
dissociated press.  Here are a few of the choicer ones I
found while mopping up after it:

bit.listserv.linkfail
houston.eahouston.forsale
compnderground.digest
comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcapc.soundcard.GUS
yp.sys.ibm.ps2.hardware

The archives are splattered among a few different places.
They are currently being kept already; no special effort is

Subject: Crazy Stupid Modem Support

The first program that I ever had, on the first computer
that I ever had, was a terminal emulator which let me log
into a bulletin board system, upload and download files, and
pretended to be a Vt100 terminal.  This was back in 1980 on
a Xitan Z80 with 60K of RAM, 4K of RAM, crammed into a 64K
address space and it flew.

So now what's up with this NeXTstation on my desk?  I have a
choice of not one, not two, not three, but four different
programs to use my brand new, 14/14 fax/data/voice modem.
My choices?  tip, cu, kermit, and Terminal (which can
connect directly to the modem port).

After several hours of trying, I've been unable to configure
any of these programs to let me dial the phone, connect,
transfer files, and log off.  tip and cu can allegedly dial
the phone, but I haven't been able to figure out how to make
it work with my particular brand of modem.  (Why don't they
just support the Hayes command set?  I don't have
racal-vadic or anything like that.)  Even if I get tip or cu
to work, they can't transfer binary files properly.  I'd use
kermit, but it doesn't know that my serial ports can run at
38,400 baud --- you ask it to set that baud rate, and it
says speed not supported.

Things were so much easier back when I was using CP/M.
